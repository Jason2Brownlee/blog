Hi I'm **Jason Brownlee**.

Welcome to my blog!

The writing here is **probably not for you**, it's for me to figure things out. It's a place where I can digest, contemplate, exorcise, and purge distracting ideas and then try to move on.

If you find something useful/interesting, reach out and tell me:

You can learn more about me and my recent projects here:
