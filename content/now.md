## What am I doing right now?

Working with LLMs a lot, all day, for everything.

Building things. Writing things. "Talking" through things.

I'm currently writing fiction, dressed as non-fiction. I am publishing publicly under a pen name. Maybe in a decade or two, I'll write something worth reading.
