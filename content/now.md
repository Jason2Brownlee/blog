## What am I doing right now?

I am trying to figure out my next move.

Sabbatical, I guess.

I'm chewing on how LLMs intersect/disrupt the things I like to do/create and how to integrate and move forward.

Some motivating questions:

* Can I still have "my own thoughts" and write them down?
* What does "programming" mean/look like now?
* What might "code tutorials" or "algorithm tutorials" look like now?
* Do programmers still want to do "copywork" to learn algorithms and data structures?
* Is there a cool technical topic I can obsess about for a few years?
