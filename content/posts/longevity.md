title: 'Longevity'

It seems that [longevity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity) and extending healthspan are hot topics again.

Sure. Who doesn't want a long healthy life?

My thinking is to stick to the basics and do them well.

Stick to the stuff that does not change and probably will not change, regardless of new fads, fashions and "scientific discoveries".

Stuff like:

* Clean eating
	* Eat whole foods
	* Eat protein
	* Eat fresh fruit and veg
	* Time restricted feeding (1pm-6pm), no snacking
	* Skip junk, simple carbs, processed foods
	* Skip drugs and alcohol
* Daily exercise
	* Walk 5km 7x/week
	* Lift weights 3x/week
	* Run 5-10km 3x/week
	* Sauna 5x/week
* Sleep (3-2-1 framework)
	* No food 3 hours before bed
	* No drinks 2 hours before bed
	* No screens 1 hour before bed (e.g. read)
	* Early to bed, early to rise

And more obvious stuff like: low stress, low pollution, etc.

I've been doing this for years and I'm better condition that I was when I was a uni student.

It works in the short term. I suspect it will impact longevity/healthspan but no one knows.

I've read [easily 70+ books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_shelves/395504929) on health and nutrition, including a few books on the topic of longevity, and don't walk away with many "todos", other than confirming the above.

For example:

* [Outlive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61153739-outlive), Peter Attia, 2023.
* [Lifespan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43723901-lifespan), David Sinclair, 2019.
* etc.

And a condensed summary of longevity tactics from "Outlive", via gpt4o:

> **Attia's Core Longevity Framework:**
>
> * ðŸ’ª Exercise First: Strength, cardio, and daily movement.
> * ðŸ¥— Optimize Metabolic Health: Control glucose, eat whole foods, prioritize protein.
> * ðŸ›Œ Prioritize Sleep: Consistency, environment, and habits.
> * ðŸ§  Mental & Emotional Well-being: Relationships, purpose, and stress management.
> * ðŸ”¬ Preventative Medicine: Early screening, tracking biomarkers, and interventions.
> * ðŸ”¥ Recovery & Longevity Hacks: Sauna, cold exposure, fasting, and (potentially) pharmaceuticals.

I think because it's so hard to do science in this area, on humans. And the small differences matter.

So back to basics. The obvious stuff.

I pitched this to our friend, gpt4o, here's his thoughts:

> If you are interested in **longevity and healthspan**, focusing on fundamental, well-established biological principles is key. These principles have remained unchanged over time and are supported by a large body of scientific research. Below are some of the most **obvious and time-tested** things you can do to **live a long and healthy life**:
>
> ### **1. Nutrition: Eat Whole, Nutrient-Dense Foods**
> - **Prioritize Whole, Unprocessed Foods** â€“ Stick to lean proteins, healthy fats, fiber-rich carbohydrates, and micronutrient-dense vegetables.
> - **Protein Intake for Muscle Maintenance** â€“ Consume adequate protein, especially as you age (~1.2â€“2.0g per kg of body weight).
> - **Healthy Fats** â€“ Incorporate omega-3s (fish, flaxseeds, walnuts) and minimize processed seed oils.
> - **Minimize Sugar & Refined Carbs** â€“ Prevent insulin resistance by reducing processed foods and maintaining stable blood sugar levels.
> - **Eat a Variety of Plants** â€“ Polyphenols, fiber, and antioxidants reduce inflammation and support gut health.
> - **Time-Restricted Eating / Fasting** â€“ Intermittent fasting (e.g., 12-16 hours daily) promotes autophagy, metabolic flexibility, and cellular repair.
>
> ### **2. Exercise: Build Strength, Cardio, and Mobility**
> - **Strength Training (2â€“4x per week)** â€“ Resistance training preserves muscle mass, prevents sarcopenia, and strengthens bones.
> - **Cardiovascular Exercise (Zone 2 & HIIT)** â€“ Regular cardio (e.g., walking, cycling, running) improves heart health and mitochondrial function.
> - **Daily Movement & Steps** â€“ Aim for **7,000-10,000 steps daily** to maintain metabolic health.
> - **Mobility & Flexibility** â€“ Yoga, stretching, and functional movement prevent injury and keep joints healthy.
>
> ### **3. Stress Management & Mental Health**
> - **Quality Sleep (7â€“9 Hours Per Night)** â€“ Prioritize consistent, high-quality sleep for recovery, cognitive function, and hormonal balance.
> - **Daily Sunlight (Especially Morning Sun)** â€“ Regulates circadian rhythm, boosts Vitamin D, and improves mood.
> - **Breathwork & Meditation** â€“ Reduces chronic stress, improves HRV, and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.
> - **Cold Exposure** â€“ Cold showers or ice baths improve stress resilience and circulation.
> - **Sauna Use (4â€“7x per Week)** â€“ Heat therapy increases longevity, cardiovascular health, and detoxification.
>
> ### **4. Metabolic & Hormonal Health**
> - **Maintain Healthy Insulin Sensitivity** â€“ Reduce ultra-processed foods and ensure metabolic flexibility.
> - **Optimize Hormones Naturally** â€“ Testosterone, estrogen, and growth hormone levels decline with age; lifestyle factors like sleep, strength training, and stress management help maintain optimal levels.
> - **Periodic Bloodwork & Biomarker Tracking** â€“ Monitor glucose levels, cholesterol, inflammatory markers, and vitamin/mineral levels.
>
> ### **5. Environmental & Lifestyle Factors**
> - **Minimize Toxins & Pollutants** â€“ Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol, endocrine disruptors (plastics, BPA, seed oils).
> - **Air Quality & Water Purity** â€“ Use air purifiers, filter your water (avoid contaminants like microplastics, fluoride).
> - **Blue Light Reduction at Night** â€“ Limit screens before bed to maintain melatonin production.
> - **Deep Relationships & Community** â€“ Strong social connections are a key determinant of longevity (Blue Zones research).
>
> ### **6. Cognitive Stimulation & Lifelong Learning**
> - **Keep Your Brain Engaged** â€“ Reading, learning new skills, and mental challenges reduce cognitive decline.
> - **Avoid Chronic Stress & Negativity** â€“ Cortisol and chronic stress accelerate aging.
> - **Practice Gratitude & Purpose** â€“ A sense of purpose is correlated with a longer lifespan.
>
> ### **7. Recovery & Regeneration**
> - **Prioritize Sleep** â€“ Most of your body's repair and regeneration happens during deep sleep.
> - **Periodic Fasting or Caloric Restriction** â€“ Mild caloric restriction has been linked to increased lifespan in many studies.
> - **Active Recovery** â€“ Massage, sauna, cold therapy, and nature exposure promote longevity.
>
> ### **Conclusion**
> These principles have remained **unchanged** for decades because they are **fundamentally aligned with human biology**. The key is **consistency**â€”no single intervention will make a big difference unless practiced regularly over time.

Nod. Some repetition in the suggestions.

My takeaway: Do the basics, and don't stop doing them.

I asked deepseek and claude and got much the same suggestions.
