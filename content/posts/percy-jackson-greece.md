title: 'Percy Jackson Greece'
---

In primary school, by eldest son loved the "[Percy Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson)" books by Rick Riordan.

Even now, they will be a fun/quick re-read for him when he's looking for a comfort-read.

These books gave him an interest in ancient Greece. I've purchased a few books for him over the years to kindle the interest, e.g.:

* [300](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59952.300), Frank Miller
* [Mythos: The Greek Myths Retold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35074096-mythos), Stephen Fry.
* [Circe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41045102-circe), Madeline Miller.
* [The Song of Achilles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13623848-the-song-of-achilles), Madeline Miller.
* [Lore Olympus](https://amzn.asia/d/b4qaPLg), Rachel Smythe.

And I'm sure I'll buy more. Probably the rest of Stephen Fry's series.

Anyway, this interest in Greece has lead to a planned trip there. Just him and myself with the goal of seeing the ancient sights, then relaxing on some islands in the Aegean.

Out of interest, I asked gpt5 to list all places in Greece mentioned in the Percy Jackson book series, to ensure we visit places knows from the books.

Here's what I got:

---

* **Athens** – central location in *The Blood of Olympus*; the site of the final battle against the giants.
* **Delphi** – referenced as the ancient site of the Oracle of Delphi, whose spirit later inhabits Rachel Dare.
* **Olympus (Mount Olympus)** – described as the home of the gods; physically located above Mount Olympus, Greece (though in the modern world, it’s magically relocated to the Empire State Building in New York).
* **Delos** – the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis; visited in *The Blood of Olympus*.
* **Sparta** – referenced in discussions of Greek heroes and mythology.
* **Mycenae** – mentioned in connection with ancient heroes like Agamemnon.
