Machine Learning Street Talk is a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MachineLearningStreetTalk) and [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/02e6PZeIOdpmBGT9THuzwR) by Tim Scarfe and sometimes Keith Duggar.

I'm a fan of the podcast, and have been for some time.

Recently, like this northern hemisphere summer, they have been releasing fantastic episodes.

Both the quality of the guests and the quality of the questions/discussion. Riveting stuff.

Specifically:

* [The Secret Ingredient for AI Creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKUKikuV58o&ab_channel=MachineLearningStreetTalk) A chat with Kenneth Stanley.
* [Did a 7 Year Old Really Solve the Universe?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR-_U0Pzl1Y&ab_channel=MachineLearningStreetTalk) A chat with Guillaume Verdon.
* [Mutually Assured AI Malfunction (Superintelligence Strategy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM1waDBNDhw&ab_channel=MachineLearningStreetTalk) A chat with Dan Hendrycks.

All three had be sitting and staring into space for a long time, thinking through things. Not sure I'm smart enough to keep up at double speed, a few listens are required.

Highly recommended.
