title: 'Dumbbell Tips'
---

With two sons, three males in the house, exercise is a big deal.

We all work out to different degrees. Fitness, strength, etc. is discussed often.

I'm getting a set of dumbbells for the boys to use. I will use them too, to complement my gym stuff.

* **Weights**: 1.5kg (we have already), then 3kg, 5kg, 8kg, 10kg.

They'll stick with the lighter weights for now, with room to grow.

I don't want them to get hurt, so I asked grok3 to help me make some posters to stick up.

The first is on safety tips when using dumbbells:

> ## **Dumbbell Training Tips**
>
> * **Start Light, Go Slow**: Choose a weight you can lift with control. Focus on slow, steady movements to build strength safely.
> * **Prioritize Form**: Keep proper postureâ€”back straight, core engaged, knees slightly bent. Bad form risks injury.
> * **Time Under Tension**: Aim for 2-3 seconds up, 2-3 seconds down per rep to maximize muscle growth.
> * **Track Reps & Sets**: Log 8-12 reps for 2-3 sets per exercise. Increase weight gradually as strength improves.
> * **Warm Up & Cool Down**: Do 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretches before and static stretches after to prevent injury.
> * **Rest & Recover**: Take 60-90 seconds between sets. Rest muscles 48 hours before training the same group again.
> * **Breathe Properly**: Exhale on effort (lifting), inhale on release. Never hold your breath.
> * **Use a Spotter for Heavy Lifts**: Have someone nearby for safety when pushing your limits.
> * **Listen to Your Body**: Stop if you feel pain (not just discomfort). Consult a doctor for persistent issues.
> * **Stay Consistent**: Train 2-3 times per week. Progress comes from regular, focused effort.

And another for exercises to start with:

> ## **Dumbbell Exercises for Strength**
>
> * **Goblet Squat**: Hold one dumbbell close to chest, squat until thighs are parallel to ground, then stand. Builds legs and core.
> * **Dumbbell Bench Press**: Lie on a bench, hold a dumbbell in each hand, push up, lower slowly. Targets chest, shoulders, triceps.
> * **Bent-Over Row**: Bend at hips, back flat, pull dumbbells to waist, lower slowly. Strengthens back and biceps.
> * **Shoulder Press**: Sit or stand, hold dumbbells at shoulder height, press up, lower with control. Works shoulders and triceps.
> * **Bicep Curl**: Stand, hold dumbbells, curl weights to shoulders, lower slowly. Focuses on biceps.
> * **Lateral Raise**: Stand, hold dumbbells at sides, raise arms to shoulder height, lower slowly. Targets side shoulders.
> * **Dumbbell Deadlift**: Hold dumbbells, hinge at hips, lower weights toward floor, then stand. Builds glutes, hamstrings, lower back.

We'll also watch some youtubes together to get good form sorted up front.
