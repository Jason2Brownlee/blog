title: 'Niche Books on the Greeks'
---

I've been sniffing around for more niche books on the Greeks.

Less overarching historical books and more biographies and reviews of specific topics.

For books on [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes), I chose:

* [Eureka Man: The Life and Legacy of Archimedes](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6785491-eureka-man), Alan Hirshfeld, 2009.

For books on [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle), I chose:

* [Aristotle: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99928.Aristotle), Jonathan Barnes, 1982.

For books on the [Ptolemaic Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty) (in Egypt), I chose:

* [The Rise and Fall of Alexandria: Birthplace of the Modern Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/400064.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Alexandria), Justin Pollard, 2006.
* [The Last Dynasty: Ancient Egypt From Alexander the Great to Cleopatra](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395501-the-last-dynasty), Toby Wilkinson, 2022.

For the discovery of Troy by [Heinrich Schliemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann) I chose:

* [The Gold of Troy: The True Story of the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20739291-the-gold-of-troy), Robert Payne, 1959.

Although I'd like a good biography of the man as well I think.

As [previously mentioned](/blog/posts/arthur-evans/), for the discovery of Knossos/Minoan civilization by Arthur Evans, I chose:

* [The Bull of Minos](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/808077.The_Bull_of_Minos), Leonard Cottrell, 1953.

For the [Cyclades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclades) generally, I chose:

* [The Cyclades: Discovering the Greek Islands of the Aegean](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1243934.The_Cyclades), John Freely, 2006.

That should keep me busy.

I'm still working my way through [Roumeli](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3181076-roumeli) and [Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27200.Sailing_the_Wine_Dark_Sea).

I also have planned a number of other more general histories.
