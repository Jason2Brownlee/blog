title: 'Dark Writing'

I'm revising my next novella.

And it's coming out dark.

Each revision is even darker.

I'm reminded of Steven Pressfield in "[Do the Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10645233-do-the-work)":

> My friend Paul is writing a cop novel. He’s never written anything so ambitious—and he’s terrified. “The story is coming out dark,” he says. “I mean twisted, weird-dark. So dark it’s scaring me.”
>
> Paul wants to know if he should throttle back. He’s worried that the book will come out so evil, not even Darth Vader will want to touch it.
>
> Answer: No way.
>
> The darker the better, if that’s how it’s coming to him.

The darker the better.

Yes Sir!
