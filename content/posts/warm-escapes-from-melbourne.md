title: 'Warm Escapes From Melbourne'
---

I live in Melbourne, Australia.

Melbourne gets (relatively) cold for about 1/2 to 2/3 of the year and it's a tradition to escape further up the east coast of the country in search of warm weather.

We do this most years, typically in the Autumn or Spring and leave winter for warm weather in the northern hemisphere.

The problem is, we always seem to go to the same old towns:

* Cairns, QLD
* Port Douglas, QLD
* Gold Coast, QLD
* Sunshine Coast, QLD

Where else can we go?

Let's turn to gpt5.1. Here are the top 10 most popular places:

* **Gold Coast, QLD** – Warm winter weather with long beaches, surf culture, theme parks, and plenty of resorts.
* **Sunshine Coast (Noosa & Mooloolaba), QLD** – Relaxed coastal vibe with beautiful beaches, national parks, and mild sunny winters.
* **Port Douglas, QLD** – Tropical resort town with warm temps, palm-lined beaches, and access to the Great Barrier Reef.
* **Cairns, QLD** – Warm, tropical city ideal for reef trips, adventure activities, and lagoon-style swimming.
* **Airlie Beach & The Whitsundays, QLD** – Tropical islands, turquoise water, sailing, and iconic beaches like Whitehaven.
* **Hamilton Island, QLD** – Resort-style island getaway with beaches, pools, and year-round warm weather.
* **Byron Bay, NSW** – Trendy coastal town with surf beaches, wellness retreats, and mild winter warmth.
* **Coffs Harbour, NSW** – Family-friendly coastal area with warm winter days, beaches, and scenic coastal walks.
* **Port Macquarie, NSW** – Relaxed mid-north coast town with beaches, nature walks, and mild winter temperatures.
* **Hervey Bay, QLD** – Calm beaches, warm winter weather, and a top spot for whale watching.

Nod.

Many places we've also been, e.g. Whitsundays/Hamilton Island, Byron Bay, etc.

Coffs Harbour is a good idea, so is Hervey Bay, but I think they are far away from major airports. I think we'd have to use a small plane and small airport. Not a fan. I might be wrong though. Port Macquarie might be too south to be warm enough.

Here's a second list, within a 1-2h drive from a "major" airport, and not included in the first list:

* **Palm Cove, QLD** – Boutique beachfront village between Cairns Airport and Port Douglas; tropical, calm, and resort-heavy.
* **Trinity Beach, QLD** – Quiet, warm, palm-fringed beach 20 minutes from Cairns Airport; less busy than Palm Cove.
* **Mission Beach (via Cairns Airport), QLD** – Lush tropical beaches around 2 hours from Cairns Airport; laid-back and warm.
* **Yeppoon (via Rockhampton Airport), QLD** – Coastal resort town with warm winter weather, access to Great Keppel Island.
* **Townsville, QLD** – Hot and dry winters, The Strand foreshore, Magnetic Island just offshore; served by Townsville Airport.
* **Magnetic Island (via Townsville Airport), QLD** – 20-minute ferry from Townsville; warm, relaxed, lots of wildlife, and beaches.
* **Bundaberg, QLD** – Sunny, mild-to-warm winters, good beaches nearby (Bargara), accessible via Bundaberg Airport.
* **Agnes Water / 1770 (via Bundaberg or Gladstone Airport), QLD** – Quiet beaches, warmer climate; ~1.5 hours from Gladstone or Bundaberg.
* **Heron Island (via Gladstone Airport), QLD** – Secluded reef island; warm and sunny in winter; ferry/helipad transfer from Gladstone.
* **Kingscliff, NSW (via Gold Coast Airport)** – Warm, gentler than Byron; resort-heavy (Salt, Peppers, Mantra areas).
* **Lennox Head, NSW (via Ballina Airport)** – Warmer than Melbourne in winter, surf-town vibe, close to Ballina Jet Airport.
* **Yamba, NSW (via Ballina Airport)** – Mild winter warmth; beaches, river, and a quieter alternative to Byron; within 90 minutes of Ballina.
* **Forster–Tuncurry, NSW (via Newcastle Airport)** – Mild winter temps, lakes + beaches, 1.5 hours from Newcastle Airport.
* **Nelson Bay / Port Stephens, NSW (via Newcastle Airport)** – Winter sun, whale watching, beaches, dunes, and resorts.
* **Emrald Beach / Sapphire Beach (via Coffs Harbour Airport)** – Warmish winters, quieter coastal pockets just minutes from Coffs Airport.

Now we're talking.

I've been to some, recognize some, but there are many new ideas here for me.

Awesome.
