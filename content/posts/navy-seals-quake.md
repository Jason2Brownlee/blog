title: 'Navy Seals Quake'
---

I've created a new Quake archive, this time for the Navy Seals modification by Minh Le aka "Gooseman".

This was originally an ad hoc archive as a gist here:

* [Navy Seals Quake](https://gist.github.com/Jason2Brownlee/70b2fdb12df050b2fe8de209eb142eee)

I decided to make it a standalone archive as I came across rare/hard-to-find versions of the mod that I believed required independent hosting.

You can see the full archive here:
