This is [another reminder](/blog/posts/tv-series-podcast/) to self:

> Book + Movie > Book | Movie

I finished reading "[Anything You Can Imagine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34522426-anything-you-can-imagine)" on the making of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Great book. Great movies, seen them many times.

But I'm re-watching them now after having read a deep dive into how hard they were to make and they are so much better.

Also, it's probably been a decade since my last watch.

But, the depth beyond the making of makes watching scenes so much more impactful. More emotional.

Just a better all round experience.

Do this more.
