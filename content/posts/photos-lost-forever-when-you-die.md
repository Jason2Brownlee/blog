title: 'Photos Are Lost Forever When You Die: We Need Digital Estate Planning'
---

I finished stuffing my last batch of printed photos into my 2025 photo album yesterday.

See [My (lame?) Family Photo Backup Process](/blog/posts/family-photos/).

Anyway, I was thinking that I only print a fraction of the photos taken. The rest are essentially lost, or will be with time.

This applies to most people, e.g. most families that take hundreds/thousands of photos every year.

So many photos/memories are lost.

Now imagine archaeologists/sociologists/anthropologists in 1,000+ years. They would give anything to access middens of these "lost" photos. These candied yet rejected snapshots of places/times/people.

When we die, these photos are lost. We take them for ourselves. The kids probably don't want them. The printed albums will end up in landfill in a generation or two.

Imagine if we could donate/will all digital media (photos/videos) to a company/non-profit that made them available under a permissive licence, perhaps after a time lag to allow people in them to also pass on. Or not. And perhaps with a filter to strip out anything too NSFW.

The systems could be backed by clever "[Internet Archive](https://archive.org)" like systems. Maybe it could be a service offered by the Internet Archive. Gee, tech millionaires/billionaires should all donate to them as a matter of course, it's such an important thing they are doing.

Anyway, this is needed.

Send in a phone/workstation with a form on filtering/delays and have people at the other end process and upload. It has to be insanely easy and appropriately protective of peoples wishes.

What is this? "_Digital Estate Planning_"?

How could the photos be used (for good)?

Who knows? Same with how can the internet archive be used for good in the short/medium? Train AIs? Anthropological reconstructions? We find clever/creative/invaluable uses.
