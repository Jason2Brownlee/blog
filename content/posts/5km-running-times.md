title: '5km Running Times'
---

I run 5km 2-3 times per week as part of my cardio day at the gym.

I have a routine of setting the pace at 6 minute kilometres initially and increasing every km. For example, the pace in minutes looks as follows over the whole 5km: 6, 5.5, 5, 4.5, 4.

This takes 25 minutes.

If I'm tired, I'll run the first 2km at a 6min pace, then increase after that, for example: 6, 6, 5.5, 5, 4.5. This takes 27 minutes.

I row and cycle before all of this. I like to end with the run.

I can go faster, but this feels good and the 4 min pace at the end feels great.

I sometimes extend the run a few more km if I'm feeling really good. I almost always set a 30min time limit and run out the final time at a 4.5min or 4min pace.

Anyway, any time I start thinking that I could run a 5km race, I look up the times to reset my expectations.

I suck bad.

And this is treadmill running, not real world running with other humans around me.

For example, according to [Male 5k Running Times](https://runninglevel.com/running-times/5k-times), here are the scores for someone around my age (I'm 44, below are times for 45):

- Beginner: 34:25
- Novice: 28:47
- Intermediate: 24:38
- Advanced: 21:34
- Elite: 19:19
- World Record: 14:03

The world record is better than 10 min faster. That is so insane to me. A 2:49min/km pace. Not sure I could do that for 10 seconds!

So I'd be better than a beginner, somewhere between novice and intermediate if I used the same kind of pace.

One day I should see if I can maintain a 4.5 minute pace for the full 5km. I think I could.

That would put me at 22.5 minutes, sitting between intermediate and advanced.

In fact, I should time myself and try and hit the advanced time.

I'll put this on my todo :)
