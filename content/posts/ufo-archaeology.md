title: 'UFO Archaeology'

I first heard [Bob Lazar's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar) story on the [Joe Rogan podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEWz4SXfyCQ&ab_channel=PowerfulJRE).

On it, I remember he mentioning that UFO craft were apparently found as part of an archaeological dig.

I later read his book "[Dreamland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43822273-dreamland)" and saw no mention of this, which was disappointing, because it's one of this nuggets that really gets your imagination going.

Regardless, it's all fun stuff.

Here's the clip from the episode:

* [Bob Lazar Says UFO was an Archaeological Finding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmF6RXf6U_A&ab_channel=JREClips)

A rough quote transcribed from the auto-generated subtitles:

> ...but something must have been said to me from Barry [...] it was just too long ago and I can't quite remember what was said, but it just left a seed in my mind. I think **at least one of them was part of an archaeological dig**, so it's old [...] at least one of them is old. I don't know if it was the one I worked on, but I remember something to do with an archaeological dig.

Fun.

Real? Almost certainly not. But great story telling.

I get visions from the stargate movie, of pulling the ring out of the desert in Egypt :)

Apparently, this is a whole thing called "Out-of-place artifacts".

It has a [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-place_artifact) and everything.
