title: 'Athens Monuments'
---

Thinking about my trip to Athens, Greece.

I was thinking, what are all the cool ancient monuments we should see?

Looking at google maps, many are in the city center, in walking distance of each other.

Searching google returns pages and pages of travel-blog-ad-spam. Useless.

Here's what gpt5.1 gave me:

---
* **Acropolis of Athens** – The iconic hilltop citadel overlooking the city.

  * **Parthenon** – The most famous temple dedicated to Athena.
  * **Erechtheion & Caryatids**, **Propylaea**, **Temple of Athena Nike**.

* **Temple of Olympian Zeus** – Once one of the largest temples in the ancient world.

* **Hadrian’s Arch** – Monumental gateway built in honor of Emperor Hadrian.

* **Ancient Agora of Athens** – Heart of ancient political and social life; includes the **Temple of Hephaestus**.

* **Roman Agora** – Includes the **Tower of the Winds**, an ancient weather and timekeeping structure.

* **Odeon of Herodes Atticus** – A beautifully preserved Roman amphitheater still used for performances.

* **Panathenaic Stadium (Kallimarmaro)** – The world’s only stadium built entirely of marble; site of the first modern Olympic Games.

* **Syntagma Square & Hellenic Parliament** – Known for the **changing of the guard** at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

* **Lycabettus Hill** – Not a monument per se, but one of the best viewpoints over Athens and the Acropolis.

Great, but there are other things not on there though, e.g. Prison of Socrates on Philopappos Hill.

If only it could plot them on a google map as a walking tour for me...:)

I think Gemini can. It generated a map and it has some/most of the places in 7 stops (6.6 km, 1 hour 42 minutes):
