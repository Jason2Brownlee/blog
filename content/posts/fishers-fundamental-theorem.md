title: 'Fishers Fundamental Theorem'
---

Among [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher)'s many contributions to statistics, genetics, and evolutionary theory at large was his "_fundamental theorem of natural selection_":

> "_The rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time._"

See:

* [Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection), Wikipedia.

In plain language (with llm help):

> “_The rate at which a population becomes better adapted (its average fitness increases) is directly proportional to the amount of genetic variation for fitness it already has._”

In other words:

* If there’s lots of genetic diversity that affects survival and reproduction, natural selection has more “raw material” to work with.
* The more variation in who leaves more offspring, the faster the population improves in fitness (adaptation).
* If there’s no variation, evolution has nothing to act on, so fitness won’t increase through selection.

Great stuff, and limited to a description of a model evolutionary process.

Online, e.g. in e/acc, I am seeing it used as justification for diversity of methods/approaches.

Something like:

> _diversity fuels progress_

I think this has weak justification.

I'd prefer an analogy from [portfolio theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

Something like:

> _spread the bets_

or

> _variance is the price of adaptability_
