Regarding [Code Simple Algorithms and Data Structures](/blog/posts/code-simple-algorithms-datastructures/):

> Which algorithms and data structures did we have to understand + code up back in introduction to compsci?

I asked gemini 2.5 flash (why doesn't it have a prominent copy button?):

### Data Structures

* Arrays
* Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
* Hash Tables

### Algorithms

* Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
* Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
* Recursion
* Graph Traversal Algorithms (Breadth-First Search - BFS, Depth-First Search - DFS)


This is a helpful reference to my future self so I can keep coding these things up without having to think "what next".
