title: 'Ideation Framework'
---

I tripped over an ideation framework by [John Rush](https://x.com/johnrushx) shared in a [tweet](https://x.com/johnrushx/status/1882277087224185312).

Here is a local copy (tweets get deleted sometimes...):

Here's the tweet where it came from:

It's a great framework.

Here's a snippet of what it means, as described by our friend gpt4o:

> - Start with **pain points** as the best source of high-quality ideas.
> - Consider **technology** as a way to adapt existing solutions or create new applications.
> - **Cloning** can be a valid strategy but typically lacks originality unless combined with significant differentiation.
> - Thoughtfully evaluate ideas' potential impact, innovativeness, and market fit.

Almost gpt buddy, good try.

What it is really saying is the best place to harvest _real_ and _valuable_ business ideas is personal pain points experienced at work. After that, find something that is working, clone it, and take in a different direction.

Reminds me of the old ["rip, pivot, jam" strategy](https://tropicalmba.com/episodes/strategy-launch-portable-bar) from back in the day.

> Using the Rip, Pivot, and Jam method they were able to find a niche, apply known business practices, and rock out a successful product line.
>
> * Rip - Identify if others in the niche are making money from it
> * Pivot - Bring it to a new market / new approach
> * Jam - Crash the boards with 100% energy

All good stuff.

And good for "profitable business ideas".

Although I like this stuff (suspect its valuable as a strategy), it's not what I have done.

An approach I've used is:

* **_Follow curiosity and work on things that I can't not work on_**

This double negative is key: "can't not work on". It's a compulsion.

Another philosophy I follow:

* **_Make things you want to exist in the world_**

This is also powerful.

I didn't come up with this phrasing, it was probably tweeted sometime in the last 15 years and I grabbed onto it. But it's the right approach for me.

Here's another framework I really like (because I have done this a few times), by [Russell Brunson](https://x.com/russellbrunson).

Local copy again in case the tweet gets deleted:

1. Take something you already do
2. Learn to do it bettern than anybody else
3. Teach it to others.

Simple. Effective.
