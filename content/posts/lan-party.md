I read "_LAN Party_" last week:

* [LAN Party: Inside the Multiplayer Revolution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189147229-lan-party), GoodReads.

More here:

* [LAN Party](https://readonlymemory.com/products/lan-party), Read-Only Memory.

It's more of a photo book with occasional essays and interviews.

I went to a lot of LAN parties in high school (circa 1995-1998, a couple after this) and it was awesome.

I ended up hosting many parties because I had a ton of network cards, cables, and space.

The best lan parties were the all day affairs. The worst were overnight/all night as nothing is fun when you're sleep deprived.

There's nothing better than having 4-8 guys in the same map in doom1/2, then quake1/2/3, then unreal/ut.

The best times were playing coop with friendly fire on so you can devolve into killing each other.

Good memories of other games, rainbow 6, gta2, warcraft2.

Later on, playing against colleagues in the office on friends in the share house was just not as good. There's something about all getting together, making the network "work", and fragging away. Also being about 15 y/o helps.
