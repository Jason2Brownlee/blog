title: 'The Greek World (The Great Courses)'
---

I finished an audio version of a course on ancient Greece yesterday:

* [The Greek World: A Study of History and Culture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54528723-the-greek-world)

It was fantastic, great high-level coverage of the topic.

I am planning two more:

* [The Long Shadow of the Ancient Greek World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227982154-the-long-shadow-of-the-ancient-greek-world)
* [Ancient Greek Civilization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2250097.Ancient_Greek_Civilization)

I also like the look of the following:

* [Great Tours: Ancient Cities of the Mediterranean](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231276918-great-tours)
* [Famous Greeks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26797632-famous-greeks)

And more.

Great for consuming and thinking through a the gym.

I forgot how awesome "[The Great Courses](https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/)" material can be.
