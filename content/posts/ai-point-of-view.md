title: 'AI Point of View'
---

I was listening to a podcast with Rick Rubin on his vibe coding book and he said some good stuff.

The interview:

* [Rick Rubin: Vibe Coding is the Punk Rock of Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s9C92Pkcc0&ab_channel=a16z)

The book:

* [The Way of Code: The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding](https://www.thewayofcode.com/)

He said AI needs a point of view. That this is what we, as artists, supply.

From the interview transcript:

> But the reason we go to the artists we go to or the writers we go to or the filmmakers we go to is for their point of view. The AI doesn't have a point of view right. A point of view is what you tell it. What you tell it the point of view is to be.

And I agree completely.

The LLM can do so many cool things, but it requires direction. A point of view.
