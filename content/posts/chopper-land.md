title: 'Chopper Land'
---

I was digging more into old [q3test bots](/blog/posts/q3test-bots/) and I found one of my old websites.

The site was called "chopper land".

![chopper land](/blog/pics/chopper-land.jpg)

I remember it started as an experiment on in my student account on an RMIT server in early 1999 (I believe Minyos or [minyos.its.rmit.edu.au](https://web.archive.org/web/20001109072000/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/)).

Found it, here:

* [http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~s9966394](https://web.archive.org/web/20001203004400/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~s9966394/index.html) (archived, Dec 2000)

I then migrated to GeoCities.

I believe the focus was initially on bots in the q3test (circa June 1999) then moved to all gaming stuff.

The link was as follows:

* [http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/](https://web.archive.org/web/19991014005341/http://www.geocities.com:80/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/) (archived, Oct 1999)


It later became http://geocities.com/q3bots which was not archived at all.

Later I hosted material on my ISP account http://zygote.alphalink.com.au/ (not archived) before eventually getting hosted on [http://planetquake.com/humandebris](https://web.archive.org/web/20010428174103/http://www.planetquake.com/humandebris/) (archived). You can see the full [archive project here](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/HumanDebrisArchive).

I noticed that I shared the URL on usenet a few times. For example:

Great page for q3bots information

And:

I have updated my webpage
http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/
Take a look, what do ya think, what needs to be changed or added?
By the way it is only for 1024x768!!!

The wayback machine has archived some of the material, which is nice.

Sadly the material for my q3bots work was not archived.

What do we have?

From the [homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/19991014005341/http://www.geocities.com:80/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/):

> G'day, my name is Jason and I am an IT student in Melbourne Australia. I am a deathmatch freak! This page is the product of my obsession. I play a hell of a lot of Quake2 and Quake3 Bots. I also like to play Unreal Tournament Bots and Half-Life Bots.
> As well as deathmatch bots I like to play single-player and consider Unreal the best that I have ever played, with the Half-Life single-player a close second.
>
> Deathmatch and playing bots are not my only interests. I spend a lot of time using and learning Linux. It is one great OS. My reason for loving it so much is that nothing is simple, it acts as a constant challenge and keeps me thinking and learning about how things work.
> I also like making maps for games, I have fiddled with map editors since  Doom2 and Duke Nukem 3D. This doesn't mean I am any good at making maps though :-)
> Because I have spent so many years playing deathmatch games and playing at lan-parties, I have developed an interest in networks. This lead me into Linux.
>
> The Quake series is, and will stay the best deathmatch game play. For this reason I am really interested in Quake3. I have been messing with the Q3 bots since I got the IHV version in early 1999.
> There is a wealth of Quake3 bot information on this page, it is or will soon be redundant, but I will keep it up only because of the huge number of hours I poured into the research.
>
> Please don't hesitate to contact me, I would appreciate any sensible comments, corrections or ideas relating to my web page or the information on it.
> If you feel that something needs to be added or expanded upon, or there is some information you need help with send me an email.

Cool!

It looks like I was rocking a Celeron 300A overclocked to 450Mhz in late 1999. Nice.

I loved my mini-disc player. Loved!

I already have a backup of my quake3 maps as they came over to the Human Debris site. The half-life maps (`bdale.zip`, `dfa.zip`, `elmo.zip`) and Unreal maps (`cow.zip`) are lost, it seems. I wonder what happened to my doom and duke3d maps? Long long gone. Never even made it online I think.

It looks like I had a file archive on <http://members.xoom.com/chopperland/> which was not archived.

I was big into Linux in 1999-2000, I believe it was my desktop for much of this time (Slackware and later RedHat).

It looks like I had a dedicated Linux Quake website at <http://members.xoom.com/LinuxFPS>, although sadly it was not archived.

I guess that I later deleted everything and redirected to planetquake:

Wow, what a find :)

The wayback machine is a wonderful thing!
