title: 'Chopper Land'
---

I was digging more into old [q3test bots](/blog/posts/q3test-bots/) and I found one of my old websites.

The site was called "chopper land".

![chopper land](/blog/pics/chopper-land.jpg)

I remember it started as an experiment on in my student account on an RMIT server in early 1999 (I believe Minyos or [minyos.its.rmit.edu.au](https://web.archive.org/web/20001109072000/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/)).

Found it, here:

* [http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~s9966394](https://web.archive.org/web/20001203004400/http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/~s9966394/index.html) (archived, Dec 2000)

I then migrated to GeoCities.

I believe the focus was initially on bots in the q3test (circa June 1999) then moved to all gaming stuff.

The link was as follows:

* [http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/](https://web.archive.org/web/19991014005341/http://www.geocities.com:80/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/) (archived, Oct 1999)


It later became http://geocities.com/q3bots which was not archived at all.

Later I hosted material on my ISP account http://zygote.alphalink.com.au/ (not archived) before eventually getting hosted on [http://planetquake.com/humandebris](https://web.archive.org/web/20010428174103/http://www.planetquake.com/humandebris/) (archived), [see the archive here](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/HumanDebrisArchive).

I noticed that I shared the URL on usenet a few times. For example:

And:

The wayback machine has archived some of the material, which is nice.

Sadly the material for my q3bots work was not archived.

What do we have?

It looks like I was rocking a Celeron 300A overclocked to 450Mhz in late 1999. Nice.

I loved my mini-disc player. Loved!

I already have a backup of my quake3 maps as they came over to the Human Debris site. The half-life maps (`bdale.zip`, `dfa.zip`, `elmo.zip`) and Unreal maps (`cow.zip`) are lost, it seems.

It looks like I had a file archive on <http://members.xoom.com/chopperland/> which was not archived.

I was big into Linux in 1999-2000, I believe it was my desktop for much of this time (Slackware and later RedHat).

It looks like I had a dedicated Linux Quake website, although sadly it was not archived.

I guess that I later deleted everything and redirected to planetquake:

Wow, what a find :)

The wayback machine is a wonderful thing!
