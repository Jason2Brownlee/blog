title: 'Insulin Sensitivity'
---

I've [read a ton of books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=health-fitness) on health, nutrition, and specifically "[low carb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet)" over the years.

The one's I've re-read the most are by Fung/Taubes/etc., for example:

* [The Obesity Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24945404-the-obesity-code) (Fung)
* [Why We Get Fat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8727466-why-we-get-fat) (Taubes)
* [The Case for Keto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52062839-the-case-for-keto) (Taubes)
* [Good Calories, Bad Calories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1820055.Good_Calories_Bad_Calories) (Taubes)
* And on...

I don't spam friends/family about eating low carb (my wife is already on-board), but I am asked why I re-read books on the topic so often, especially since I'm not involved in health/nutrition in any way.

And I'm not obese, far from it, I have a trim runners build. I weigh as much as I did as a grad student who ran 20km 3-4/per week.

So Why? Why do I keep re-reading these books every year?

I have a subjective experience: **eating carbs makes me fatten, really fast**.

It might even be true.

I know, carbs in everything, let's go with simple carbs/starchy carbs/sugar and friends.

A week abroad or at a resort with the family and eating what/when I want results in an easy 5+/kg gain when I return. Even if I do daily 5km runs.

An [ad libitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_libitum) feast like Christmas or Chinese new year is dangerous and must be managed so that it does not bleed into the subsequent days, e.g. give away/throw out all "bad" leftovers or have it away from the home so someone else can deal with what's left.

Yeah, water weight, I know. But also, more.

It takes a 1-2 weeks to "recover" from a week away. I've tracked my weight/meals/etc. in a google sheet for 10+ years. I have the graphs and linear models :)

Also, there's a psychological+physiological thing going on. I get "hacked":

Eating sweet food makes me want to eat more sweet food, like clockwork. Cause and effect. It's a physical thing I feel in my stomach, an ache, like hunger, but I know from experience it's not. The bugs in my stomach want more sugar and are telling me all about it (that's the story I tell myself). If not killed off (with water, coffee, protein), it turns into a "head hunger" (e.g. intrusive thoughts, mouthwatering, talking about food). Bad.

I'm an addict (not really). **The solution for me is abstinence**.

My wife offers me an ad hoc spoon of ice cream and I have to reminder her I'm an ~~addict~~ animal. One spoon won't be enough. I'll need to finish the tub, or jump in the car and purchase another (not joking, this has happened).

* 1 spoon -> 1 tub
* 1 slice -> 1 cake
* 1 cookie -> 1 package
* you get the idea... I'm a beast.

There's no "have a taste". I'm all in.

The books are a reminder that I have a "_problem_" and to "_stay on the path_". I am using quotes, because this is soft compared to people with real problems and real addictions and the consequences thereof.

I brainwash myself annually that I am "**_carbohydrate intolerant_**". Maybe I am. Who cares.

This scientific-sounding story around "_insulin sensitivity_" is helpful.

It doesn't have to be true, but it helps and I get the result I want: to stay slim and (I think) healthy.

I stick to a whole foods diet generally with high-ish protein (e.g. red meat, eggs, nuts). Carbs are allowed in of course, but only via fresh salad/fruit/veg, with all fiber in-tact. If I want something sweet: I eat seasonal fruit, and it's always awesome. I mostly eat the same meals over and over and over.

This optimized scheme works really well for me.

Time-restriction works for me, but fasting doesn't.

I'll eat too much at the next meal. Also, I love to exercise (lift, run, sauna), and the more I do, the more hungry I am, and I need to satiate the hunger, not wait a day.

Anyway, why? Why isn't one read of the books enough.

Also, I can't "talk myself down" when I go off the rails for a day/week.

Each time I get off track, I write about it in various docs, and this does not help. I have a github full of what to do and how to do it right and it does nothing.

The reflection does nothing.

I have to re-brainwash myself about the evils of "[insulin resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance)" (as though I have any idea what it's all about from pop-sci books).

I have to "be told" and it has to be dressed up in (pseudo-)scientific garb for me to swallow it.

Maybe it's just spaced repetition at book-sized cards. Could be.

It's been a decade of this nonsense. How long can this go on? Probably another 40 years.
