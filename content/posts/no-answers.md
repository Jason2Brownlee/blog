title: 'No Answers For You Here'
---

When I'm working on a larger project, my brain want's to get all distracted.

To go off and read "news" or "socials". To do anything other than the next step to [move things forward](/blog/posts/move-it-forward/).

Especially after finishing a task.

This may also happen at the beginning of a work session before starting a task. We'll it did before I really [dialed-in my warm-up routine](https://lovecraftcopywork.com/).

I have a trick to pull myself out and _get back to it_.

I say to myself:

> _**there are no answers for you here**_

The reason why this works is because I know I am working on a big project/thing and I want to finish that thing. I know it's hard and there are a million tiny problems to solve in order to move it forward.

The refrain "_there are no answers for you here_" reminds me that reading twitter or reddit or hackernews or whatever will not solve these problems for me and move my project forward. And never will.

There may be answers right here though, on writing this blog. Indirectly perhaps. In jettisoning distracting thoughts so I can put the eye of Sauron's focus back on _the main thing_. Big maybe, though.

Anyway, back to it.

Oh, and dear reader, if you're out there: for sure, there are no answers for **_YOU_**. Here.
