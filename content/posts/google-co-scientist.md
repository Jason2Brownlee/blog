Google's LLM agent-based co-scientist looks interesting:

> Early tests of Google’s new tool with experts from Stanford University, Imperial College London and Houston Methodist hospital found it was able to generate scientific hypotheses that showed promising results.

> We introduce AI co-scientist, a multi-agent AI system built with Gemini 2.0 as a virtual scientific collaborator to help scientists generate novel hypotheses and research proposals, and to accelerate the clock speed of scientific and biomedical discoveries.

Nice.

But then there's this:

* [AI cracks superbug problem in two days that took scientists years](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz6e9edy3o)

> A complex problem that took microbiologists a decade to get to the bottom of has been solved in just two days by a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Professor José R Penadés and his team at Imperial College London had spent years working out and proving why some superbugs are immune to antibiotics. He gave "co-scientist" - a tool made by Google - a short prompt asking it about the core problem he had been investigating and it reached the same conclusion in 48 hours.

Hmmm.

> "I was shopping with somebody, I said, 'please leave me alone for an hour, I need to digest this thing,'" he told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four.

Ontological shock!!

I have had this a few times over the years. Read a thing or do a thing and then have to be left alone to recover from the implications. Go for a walk. "defrag the old hard disk".

And:

> "It's not just that the top hypothesis they provide was the right one," he said.
>
> "It's that they provide another four, and all of them made sense.
>
> "And for one of them, we never thought about it, and we're now working on that."

Very cool story. Great click bate!

Maybe real, [maybe not](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43115548).

> I’d bet the hypothesis was already in the training data. ([link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43115548))

Nod, in some version.

Paper, I think, found via lead author [José Penadés](https://x.com/jrpenades) on twitter:

* [AI mirrors experimental science to uncover a novel mechanism of gene transfer crucial to bacterial evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.19.639094v1)

> Here, we challenge the ability of a recently developed LLM-based platform, AI co-scientist, to generate high-level hypotheses by posing a question that took years to resolve experimentally but remained unpublished...

We can all see this, "[idea sex](/blog/posts/conceptual-blending/)": novelty by recombining ideas across/within fields give a larger (full!) corpus + working memory + automated reasoning.

Lots of low hanging fruit to be picked in the next few years.

For example:

And

> Sometimes science isn’t doing completely novel things, but combining ideas across different disciplines or areas. AI has some potential here, because unlike a human, AI can be trained across all of it and has the opportunity to make connections a human, with more limited scope, might miss. ([link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43115548))

And, importantly, the human must be in the loop at this stage:

> What matters isn't that an AI "make connections", it's that the AI generates some text that causes a human to make the connections. It doesn't even matter if what the AI generates is true or not, if it leads the human to truth. ([link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43115548))


We'll be getting [Incomprehensible Artifacts](/blog/posts/incomprehensible-artifacts/) soon enough, I'm sure :)
