I re-read [Borne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31451186-borne) last week and liked it. It's good, but not great.

First time round, I hated it and DNF. I guess this time I was ready.

It's the first in a series, the [Borne series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/221766-borne).

I'm still reading [The Strange Bird](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654201-the-strange-bird). It too is good.

Directly after Borne, I read [Dead Astronauts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37589179-dead-astronauts).

The cover is so great!

I had tried reading this before and DNF. I finished this time, the end was a slog and I remain not a fan.

It's not for me. The story/plot is like tissue paper. You handle it too much and it breaks apart. Probably I'm to dense to see all the connections. Perhaps it's too abstract or too surreal for me. Also, there's a sequence where the reader is directly lectured to about the environment. Error.

The series cannot touch the Southern Reach or Ambergris. The Borne series feels more YA. Which is fine, but less adult than other Vandermeer stories.

Still, this whole situation it's a good reminder that you need to be ready for a story. That it's okay to bail out of a story and come back to it later when you are ready and enjoy it.
