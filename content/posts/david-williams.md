I'm youngest is reading a ton of [David Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Walliams) books, much like his older brother did before him.

I've not read them, what are they all about?

Firstly, who is David Williams?

Via grok3:

> David Walliams, born David Edward Williams on August 20, 1971, in London, England, is a multifaceted English comedian, actor, writer, and television personality. He gained prominence through his collaboration with Matt Lucas on the BBC sketch comedy series *Little Britain* (2003–2006) and *Come Fly With Me* (2010–2011). Beyond comedy, Walliams has become a bestselling children’s author, with books like *The Boy in the Dress* and *Gangsta Granny*, selling over 50 million copies worldwide and often compared to Roald Dahl’s work. He served as a judge on *Britain’s Got Talent* from 2012 to 2022, earning multiple National Television Awards for Best TV Judge. Walliams is also known for his charity efforts, including swimming the English Channel and River Thames for Sport Relief, raising significant funds. His diverse career spans television, literature, and philanthropy, marked by a distinctive humorous and heartfelt style.

Ah yes, I remember him.

50 million copies sold is no joke!

What is his writing style?

> David Walliams' writing style, particularly in his children’s books, is characterized by a playful, humorous, and accessible tone that blends wit with heartfelt storytelling, often likened to Roald Dahl. His narratives are fast-paced, filled with quirky characters, absurd situations, and a touch of mischief, engaging young readers while incorporating subtle moral lessons. Walliams employs vivid, exaggerated imagery and clever wordplay, creating a whimsical yet relatable world. His stories often feature underdog protagonists, celebrating individuality and resilience, with a balance of lighthearted comedy and poignant moments that resonate emotionally. The inclusion of dark humor and occasional gross-out elements appeals to children’s sense of fun, while his conversational style and frequent use of direct address make readers feel involved. Enhanced by Tony Ross’s expressive illustrations, Walliams’ prose is dynamic, inclusive, and adept at capturing both the absurdities and tenderness of childhood.

Nod, so like a modern Roald Dahl.

No wonder the 30 million copies.
