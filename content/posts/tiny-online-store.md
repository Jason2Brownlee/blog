title: 'Tiny Online Store'
---

It would be nice to have a tiny store online that could just sit there for decades.

Focus on one tiny and useful need and do it well, world class.

Sell one or a few tiny products or services for that one thing.

Not a full time thing, free content, self-serve product sales with on-demand support.

I guess [SuperFastPython](https://SuperFastPython.com) fits the bill, but even it's scope is too large.

Ideally one thing. One algorithm, or one data structure, or one library/module.

A micro-authority site I guess.
