title: '(Un)Limited Video Game Time'
---

My eldest loves playing video games, which is understandable.

We limit screen time per day.

Why?

Generally, I say things like:

> It feels like you are achieving goals, but it is all fake.

And:

> It ramps up your emotions and makes you overly angry when you talk to us.

Fine.

What does gp5.2 have to say as the main negative points against:

* **It crowds out real life** — games take time away from school, sports, friends, and sleep
* **It messes with your brain’s reward system** — games give fast rewards, so real work feels boring
* **It makes stopping harder** — you get used to instant fun and struggle with self-control
* **School can suffer** — focus, homework, and reading get harder
* **Sleep gets worse** — late gaming = bad sleep and worse mood
* **Social skills can shrink** — less practice talking and hanging out in real life
* **Emotions get bigger** — more anger, frustration, or anxiety when you can’t play
* **Your body pays a price** — sitting too much hurts fitness, posture, and health
* **Real goals feel slow** — real achievements don’t “level up” as fast as games
* **It can turn into a habit you don’t control** — you think about games even when you shouldn’t

And a persuasive paragraph about why limiting video game time per day is important, targeting a 14 y/o:

> Limiting video game time matters because games are designed to feel exciting all the time, but real life isn’t—and if you spend too long in games, real goals start to feel boring or pointless even though they’re the ones that actually shape your future. School, sports, skills, friendships, and health work more slowly, but they stack up in ways games never can: they open doors, build confidence, and give you freedom later on. Playing some games is fine, but if gaming takes over your day, it quietly steals time from sleep, focus, and opportunities you don’t get back. Setting limits isn’t about punishment—it’s about making sure games stay entertainment, not something that decides who you become.

Not bad.

It's the gist of a "sit-down conversation" I've have with him.
