A piece of fruit after dinner is a delight.

I look forward to it.

This is a reminder that if you're trying to slim down, drop the fruit.

I've been eating a piece or two after dinner for the last two weeks and my weight has plateaued for that time.

Even though calories are low, e.g. deficit.

It's probably water retention, but still. Stop.

Fruit undoes all the good work.

Pause the fruit.
