I just just looking over my "Machine Learning Mischief" project from December last year:

* [Machine Learning Mischief](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/MachineLearningMischief)

Good stuff.

Very fun to think about, write about, and develop examples about.

I was idly thinking of turning this into a book.

No audience though... oh well.

Maybe expand a subtopic and do that? e.g. seed hacking/p-hacking.

Or maybe get out there and market/promote the ideas.
