title: "Alexander the Great's Tomb"
---

Reading books about the [Ptolemaic Dynasty recently](/blog/posts/ptolemaic-dynasty-timeline/) and I was thinking about Alexander's tomb.

Where is it? It's a whole thing, e.g.:

* [Tomb of Alexander the Great, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Alexander_the_Great)

In various books, there's mention of Romans coming in and visiting the tomb in Alexandria.

So he died somewhere (Babylon), was buried (Memphis, after being stolen while on the way back to Macedon), was dug up and re-buried (in Alexandria). And this may have happened again, few more times.

Maybe it is still in Alexandria. Many people believe this.

But this means, the tomb was destroyed (naturally or otherwise), forgotten, then built over. Perhaps a few times.

Via gpt5:

> Large sections of ancient Alexandria — including the royal quarter where the tomb probably stood — are now: buried under 10–15 meters of later construction, or submerged underwater in the harbor.

Huh. Wow.

Probably naturally. It's probably under the sea, like a lot of the old city. I had no idea.
