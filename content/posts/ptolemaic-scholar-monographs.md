title: 'Ptolemaic Scholar Monographs'

I finished another book on the Ptolemaic Dynasty this week:

* [The Rise and Fall of Alexandria: Birthplace of the Modern Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/400064.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Alexandria)

Very good.

A thing that got me thinking was that so many of the scholars in the great library wrote so many monographs. Some wrote many hundreds of works. The length may have been short, but that doesn't matter. They were working hard and outputting stand-alone work product.

I guess that was the thing to do, e.g. no culture of peer-to-peer scientific papers. Instead, gather all ideas into short books.

I guess this kind of thing was also popular in the late enlightenment too.

I love writing monographs, but I try to make them useful to others and profitable to me. At least I used to.

I'm inspired to write more monographs with myself as the audience. And to exclude/ignore profit motive. Just write up research and analysis of cool stuff.
