I have written a novella for my youngest son (e.g. targets age 6 to 12).

It's about him and his brother visiting their favourite holiday destination.

The title is: "**The Bali Coin**"

Here's the cover:

Here's the blurb:

> One mysterious coin. Two brothers. The adventure of a lifetime.
>
> When seven-year-old Jon and his teenage brother Alex arrive in Bali for a sun-filled family vacation, they anticipate lazy pool days, towering sandcastles, and endless breakfast buffets. But everything changes when Jon discovers a peculiar, ancient coin hidden in the sand, sparking an unforgettable adventure. Adorned with mysterious symbols, the relic points to secrets scattered across the island.
>
> As the brothers join forces to unravel the coin's enigma, they explore scorching beaches, dodge curious lizards, and slip past their parents' watchful gaze, all while pursuing hints of long-lost treasures. With their return flight looming, can Jon and Alex unlock the island's mysteries, or will the coin's secrets stay buried forever?
>
> Ideal for young readers and families, The Bali Coin is a joyful, humorous story of sibling teamwork, endless wonder, and the excitement of exploration.

It was a lot of fun to write, and I think, to read.
