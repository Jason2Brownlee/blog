I'm re-reading "[Lies My Doctor Told Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36602083-lies-my-doctor-told-me)".

It's good.

What I really like is the structure.

Something like lie, science-backed truth and it finishes with further reading or "homework.

It encourages the reader to do their homework and come to the same conclusions. And the book recommendations are solid.

Great stuff.
