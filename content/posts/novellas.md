title: 'Novellas, Why Bother?'
---

I've been writing novellas for my kids for the past few months.

They are probably objectively terrible.

Why bother?

It helps to turn this question around.

What if someone else was writing novellas and asked what I thought? What if one my kids was writing novellas and asked?

I would think it was awesome, and to keep going!

- You're practising how to conceive, execute and deliver, on project.
- You're practising how to develop a compelling story by trial and error.
- You're practising how to collaborate with LLMs for prose, descriptions, images, proofreading, copyediting, etc.

You must iterate in order to get good. Make 100 and make each one 1% better than the one before it. Repeat.

Try lots of different things. Be as creative as you can stand.

As long as you finish each project that is started and that the work product is always made public, e.g. posted on a writing forum, made available on kindle or google books, etc.

Finishing and making the work product public adds a little extra pressure/stress that improves the work.

It's a forcing function on quality and point of view, e.g. how would a stranger see this. How would my friends/family see this? etc.

Keep going for as long as you're enjoying it.

Turning the table back around: okay, I will.
