title: 'Calorie Deficit Tips'
---

Back from long holidays and I've put on 5kg/10lbs like it was nothing.

Calorie deficit time.

To get me in the mood, I sat down with Claude we wrote ~400 tips for maintaining a calorie deficit.

I then hooked this up to my auto-tweeter and created a new twitter account:

* [Calorie Deficit Tips](https://x.com/DeficitMastery)

It tweets new tips every 2 hours around the clock.

I make sure to read the last few tips every time I'm on twitter to stay on the path.

For example:
