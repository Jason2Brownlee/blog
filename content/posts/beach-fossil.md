My latest novella has been published.

Here are some links:

* [Paperback](https://amzn.to/3Grm708)
* [Kindle](https://amzn.to/3ELQbTN)

It is on [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=auFZEQAAQBAJ) and [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232270387-beach-fossil).

No Audible version yet, but I will soon. It will take some work.

It came together really fast and after the first few iterations I had little to change.

It is also the shortest and the simplest novella so far.

Like the previous two ([All Our Eyes](/blog/posts/all-our-eyes/) and [Squidstone Hollow](/blog/posts/squidstone-hollow/)) it is epistolary, although this one is based on blog posts from 2020, journal entries from 1960, and letters from 1859.

A few really good "photos" in there too!

Hereâ€™s the blurb from the back cover:

> Some secrets refuse to stay buried beneath the sand.
>
> When Melbourne's suffocating COVID lockdowns trap 13-year-old Jack Hunter indoors, he stumbles upon an unlikely escape: fossil hunting along the rugged shores of Beaumaris Bay. What starts as a reluctant distraction from endless Zoom classes quickly spirals into a mystery as Jack unearths a peculiar artefact that defy explanation: a rock laced with metallic veins, heavy with secrets the tides can't wash away.
>
> But Jack isn't alone in his fascination. Generations before him, others have been drawn to the same windswept bay. In the 1960s, a young girl named Eleanor Whitby uncovered a similar enigma, catching the eye of shadowy strangers. A century earlier, a Victorian scientist stumbled upon something even more confounding, igniting suggestions of lost histories. Each discovery hints at a thread connecting past and present, a puzzle buried in the sand that refuses to stay hidden.
>
> As we dig deeper, the stakes rise. Strange visitors cast long shadows, and the artefacts seem to pulse with questions: What links these finds across time? Why do they stir such unsettling interest? Told through a mesmerizing tapestry of blog posts, journal entries, and faded letters, Beach Fossil unveils a tale of curiosity and wonder, where every stone turned could unearth a marvel or a mystery too vast to grasp.
>
> Step onto the shores of Beaumaris Bay, where the past whispers through the waves.
