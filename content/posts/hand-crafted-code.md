title: 'Hand-Crafted Artisanal Code'
---

I've been thinking a lot about the future of programming, from the programmer's perspective.

There's a lot of chatter in the wild web that given LLMs can generate snippets, functions and even whole scripts based on prompts, and they're often very good, that we're headed to a world where human-written code may be less and less likely.

We're collaborating on code for now, but that won't last. We'll alphago and stockfish professional programmers out of existence like we did human dominance in other games.

Code, UI, and whole systems will be on-demand in many cases, and developed+maintained by LLMs in many other cases.

Some are retreating already, in the face of rising LLM usage.

For example, I love the idea of **slow code**, which I found via Frank Ray in his post "[The SLOW CODE Movement: Reclaiming the joy of coding](https://medium.com/the-autistic-engineer/the-slow-code-movement-reclaiming-the-joy-of-coding-2d4d35318823)".

> Slow coding is about enjoying the very act of writing code. It's the experience of sitting comfortably, thinking carefully, being focused, and becoming one with the tooling. It's about working in a way that enhances emotional self-regulation and promotes physical and mental relaxation. It's about finding the right balance of communicating with colleagues and periods of isolated, individual endeavour.

I love the name. I love the ethos. I love writing code in this way for myself. Or I did, I think I love the LLM-based approach more because **I can make better things, faster**.

Anyway, the typical response is that we programmers will retrieve to hobbyists producing hand-crafted artisanal code.

Like hand-made shoes, and clothes, and wooden furniture.

Just [one example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42900380):

> ...Being a programmer today is like being someone in the early 20th century who enjoyed the craft and mastery of being a cold type typesetter. You could continue to do letterpress printing even as wave after wave of new technologies came along, but something which was necessary and state of the art was transformed into either a boutique small business or a quaint hobby, like calligraphy.

The piece that is left out is that the expectation is that there will be a market for these hand crafted computational artifacts, like there is a market for hand-crafted physical items and people are willing to pay more.

There won't me a market.

[This response](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42900887) to the above comment really hits home:

> I understand what you're saying but while artisan printing and calligraphy are visible articulations of the craft, skill, care and attention that go into their making, do you think the same can be said for “artisan, human-crafted code”? [...] My opinion is it's unlikely that human-crafted code will have the same inherent value that human crafted typography does, for all sorts of reasons to do with the way we can consume physical artefacts of language vs the way we consume code.

Nod.

No one will want (to pay for) your/our hand-crafted artisanal code down at the farmers market in the 2030s. We need to get okay with this idea.

From our buddy, gpt4o, chatting about all this with me:

> Unlike handmade shoes or clothes, which have tangible differences in comfort, durability, and style, software doesn't have an aesthetic in the same way—it's primarily valued for functionality, efficiency, and correctness. If AI-generated code is superior, hand-crafted code would mostly be redundant.

Right now perhaps, (some) code written by an LLM is better than the average developer.

Soon it will be better than the top developers, then the very best developers. I think this progression is reasonable and to be expected.

For those in the market for code to solve business problems, why would they want programs that cost more and are likely less capable, just because they were written by a human?

Is someone going to value a binary compiled from hand-crafted code written by a master as much as another luxury good, like a Rolex? A very soft "maybe", but not likely. Perhaps for extreme security or performance situations where you can't trust or rely on current-at-the-time generative AI tech?

Programming will become a hobby only, a niche passion. Programming as a craft will be a blip in history before the machines could instruct themselves and each other, like humans do.

Hand-crafted code will be like hand-crafted math proofs. Perhaps something to entertain you in your down time and quaint artifacts you can show your friends and family.

Maybe for fun, we will watch living coding _performances_ and _competitions_ where we can watch other humans craft code.
