title: 'Gou Tanabe Lovecraft Manga'
---

I've been reading manga by [Gou Tanabe](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19265090.Gou_Tanabe).

Specifically his adaptations of Lovecraft stories.

And they are so good! 5/5!

More modern, more fun than the origional stories. Stories that I've read many times over.

I've read his "[The Call of Cthulhu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204191787-h-p-lovecraft-s-the-call-of-cthulhu)" and "[The Shadow Over Innsmouth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123846397-h-p-lovecraft-s-the-shadow-over-innsmouth)".

I have "[The Hound and Other Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32961082-h-p-lovecraft-s-the-hound-and-other-stories)" next and am about to order his "The Colour Out of Space".

He has a two volume "At the Mountains of Madness" that I am considering. Although I did just read the story again recently.
