title: 'Move It Forward'
---

I have a yellow sticky note that says:

> "Move it forward!"

It means: stop procrastinating.

Stop thinking. Don't think. Now is not the time for that.

Now is the time for acting. Take action.

Do one thing to move the project forward.

No matter how small.

- Read a thing.
- Format a thing.
- Edit a thing.
- Talk through a thing.

Doing one small thing will kick-start the engine and get things moving again.

It always does.

Move it forward!
