title: 'Useful Not True'
---

Yesterday I read Derek Sivers' "[Useful No True](https://sive.rs/u)".

Should there be a comma in that title?

Anyway, good book.

I think the thesis is something like:

> Actions over beliefs. Hack your beliefs to achieve desired actions.

Gaslight oneself?

This is not bad. We all do this anyway, just take the reigns.

Via chatgpt5:

> The book argues that we should adopt beliefs, perspectives, and thoughts not because they are absolutely true, but because they are useful. Its central idea is reframing: deliberately shifting the way we interpret reality in order to act more effectively, feel more at peace, or achieve our goals.

The hard part is figuring out what is "useful" or "effective" is for a given person/situation. To figure out what one desires in order to bend beliefs and therefore actions toward it.

Figuring out what you want.

So, if I have the desire to cut weight over the next two weeks (e.g. calorie deficit), how might I reframe (hack) beliefs to achieve this desired action? Ignore truth and adopt directionally useful beliefs.

Stuff like:

- Hunger is fat leaving my body. Every pang is proof the process is working.
- Every meal is a vote for the future version of me.
- Each rep is me carving the body I want.
- Two weeks is plenty of time to change my trajectory.
- My discipline inspires others, even if they don’t say it.

And on.

Beliefs, more specific to a calorie deficit:

- Hunger means fat is leaving me.
- Half a plate is all I need. the other half was just habit.
- That snack is 30 minutes on the treadmill. Not worth it.
- I don’t need to feel full, I need to feel light.
- Logging food is like checking my bank account, it keeps me wealthy in results.
- I can enjoy company without copying their portions.
- Snacking is just stealing from dinner, why rob myself later?
- I’m the kind of person who eats for fuel, not feelings.
- Water fills the space food used to.
- Protein is my ally, it keeps me satisfied for hours.
- I only eat what I planned, anything else is someone else’s choice, not mine.
- Every meal is either an investment or a debt.

And on.

Reduce friction. Build momentum. Stay consistent.

I'm perverting the book's message a bit, but I like it.

Imagine an LLM agent whispering these kids of thing, tailored to context at opportune moments all day long.

It could be super-effective, but could also go off the rails.
