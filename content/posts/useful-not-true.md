title: 'Useful Not True'
---

Yesterday I read Derek Sivers' "[Useful No True](https://sive.rs/u)".

Should there be a comma in that title?

Anyway, good book.

I think the thesis is something like:

> Actions over beliefs. Hack your beliefs to achieve desired actions.

Gaslight oneself? This is not bad. We all do this anyway, just take the reigns.

Via chatgpt5:

> The book argues that we should adopt beliefs, perspectives, and thoughts not because they are absolutely true, but because they are useful. Its central idea is reframing: deliberately shifting the way we interpret reality in order to act more effectively, feel more at peace, or achieve our goals.

The hard part is figuring out what is "useful" or "effective" is for a given person/situation. To figure out what one desires in order to bend beliefs and therefore actions toward it. Figuring out what you want.

So, if I have the desire to cut weight over the next two weeks (e.g. calorie deficit), how might I reframe (hack) beliefs to achieve this desired action? Ignore truth and adopt directionally useful beliefs.

Stuff like:

- Hunger is fat leaving my body. Every pang is proof the process is working.
- Every meal is a vote for the future version of me.
- Each rep is me carving the body I want.
- Two weeks is plenty of time to change my trajectory.
- My discipline inspires others, even if they donâ€™t say it.

And on.

Reduce friction. Build momentum. Stay consistent.

I'm perverting the book's message a bit, but I like it.
