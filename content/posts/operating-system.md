title: 'Operating System'

It's fun to think about an "operating system" for life.

For example, below are some parts of my OS.

Nutrition:

* Eat whole foods (meat and vegetables)
* Eat at meal times only
* Eat within an 6 hour interval (1-6pm)

Exercise:

* 1h weights 3x week
* 1h cardio 2x week
* 15-20m sauna 5x week
* Walk/stairs whenever possible (shops, kids school, etc.)

Consumption:

* Watch 1h of screen per day (ideally a serialized drama or half a movie)
* Audiobooks during exercise (walking, gym, etc.)
* Read in the afternoons (paperbacks)
* Read before sleep (kindle)

Other stuff, I don't know were it fits:

* Write daily
* Go to bed early and rise early (e.g. 9pm-5am)
* Always have a project where you're making something (e.g. writing, coding, researching, etc.)
* Always have an event to look forward to (e.g. travel)

This is all doing scheduled stuff.

Stoicism is a good operating system for thinking.
