title: 'Operating System'
---

It's fun to think about an "operating system" for life.

For example, below are some parts of my OS.

Nutrition:

* Eat whole foods (meat and vegetables)
* Eat at meal times only
* Eat within an 6 hour interval (1-6pm)

Exercise:

* 1h weights 3x week
* 1h cardio 2x week
* 15-20m sauna 5x week
* Walk/stairs whenever possible (shops, kids school, etc.)

Consumption:

* Watch 1h of screen per day (ideally a serialized drama or half a movie)
* Audiobooks during exercise (walking, gym, etc.)
* Read in the afternoons (paperbacks)
* Read before sleep (kindle)

Other stuff, I don't know were it fits:

* Write daily
* Go to bed early and rise early (e.g. 9pm-5am)
* Always have a project where you're making something (e.g. writing, coding, researching, etc.)
* Always have an event to look forward to (e.g. travel)

This is all doing scheduled stuff.

Stoicism is a good operating system for thinking.

I asked grok3 that if stoicism is my OS, what are the programs, the answer is helpful:

- **Negative Visualization (Premeditatio Malorum)**: Mentally rehearse potential challenges or losses to prepare for adversity, reduce fear, and build resilience by imagining worst-case scenarios and accepting them calmly.
- **Amor Fati (Love of Fate)**: Embrace and accept everything that happens, good or bad, as necessary and beneficial, reframing undesirable events as opportunities for personal growth.
- **The Dichotomy of Control**: Focus only on what you can control (thoughts, actions, attitudes) and let go of what you can’t (external outcomes, others’ opinions) to reduce stress and act effectively.
- **Journaling (Self-Reflection)**: Build self-awareness and align actions with Stoic virtues by writing about your daily actions, emotions, and decisions, reflecting on where you can improve.
- **The View from Above**: Gain perspective on problems by imagining yourself from a cosmic vantage point, where personal issues seem small compared to the vastness of time and space.
- **Practicing Voluntary Discomfort**: Build resilience and reduce attachment to comfort by deliberately embracing hardships, such as skipping meals or taking cold showers.
- **Memento Mori (Remember Death)**: Reflect on life’s impermanence to prioritize meaningful actions and focus on what truly matters by reminding yourself daily of mortality.
- **The Discipline of Assent**: Pause before reacting to thoughts or emotions, evaluate them rationally, and choose reasoned responses to maintain control over your judgments.
