title: 'Code Copywork'
---

I posted to reddit, asking if other programmers learned the craft via copy work:

* [Did you copy/transcribe code from books when learning to program?](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ik8axj/did_you_copytranscribe_code_from_books_when/)

Lots of self-selecting [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) + [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).

E.g. those that survived (and are on reddit and comment on questions) used this method, those that didn't, didn't.

I guess I really want to hear stories of people that don't learn this way.

The [copy-and-pasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-and-paste_programming) (code copypastas? the horror!).

## What is "copywork with code" called?

Anyway, this got me thinking, "_what's this called?_"

We know in fiction and copywriting we call it "copywork".

Via Gemini v2 Flash (Gv2F?)

> **Copywork** is the practice of copying a text by hand.

What do we call "_copywork for programming?_"

I asked our llm friends, with a focus on the the 1980s and 1990s (and earlier) when copying code from magazines was a big deal. In many cases, the only way to play games.

Claude (with light editing/formatting):

> * "**Type-in programs**" was the most common and widely used term, referring to the practice of manually typing program listings from magazines into your computer
> * "**Program listings**" or "code listings" were the standard terms for the actual printed code in magazines like COMPUTE!, Creative Computing, and Byte
> * "**Key-in programs**" was another variant term used by some publications and computer users during this era
> * "**Source listings**" was a more technical term sometimes used, especially in more professionally-oriented computer magazines
> * "**Keyboard software**" was an occasional term used to describe these programs that users had to manually input
> * "**Listing of the month**" or "Program of the month" were regular features in many computer magazines where they'd publish one significant program to type in
> * "**BASIC listings**" was a specific term often used since many of these programs were written in BASIC, the dominant programming language for home computers at the time
> * "**Public domain software listings**" was sometimes used when magazines published freely distributable programs that readers could type in
> * "**Magazine programs**" became a colloquial term among computer hobbyists referring to any software published in print form that required manual entry

Of course: _Type-in programs_.

Definition via Gemini:

> **Type-In Programs** were computer source code printed in magazines or books that users would manually type into their computers.

This is the standard term.

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_program):

> A type-in program or type-in listing was computer source code printed in a home computer magazine or book. It was meant to be entered via the keyboard by the reader and then saved to cassette tape or floppy disk. The result was a usable game, utility, or application program.

This is not quite a pedagogical tool.

It's a method of distribution, because it was cheaper to print the code on paper than to ship a tape/floppy/etc.

Deepseek:

> - **Type-In Programs**: This was one of the most common terms used to describe the activity of typing in code listings from magazines.
> - **Listings**: The actual code provided in magazines was often referred to simply as "listings."
> - **Type-Ins**: Another term for the programs that readers would type into their computers.
> - **Type-In Software**: Refers to the software that was created by typing in the code from magazines.
> - **Type-In Games**: Specifically, games that were provided as code listings for readers to type in and play.
> - **Type-In Utilities**: Programs that served practical purposes, such as business or math utilities, provided as code listings.
> - **Type-In Applications**: Broader term for any application software provided in this format.
> - **Type-In Code**: The actual lines of code that readers would input into their computers.
> - **Type-In Projects**: Sometimes referred to as projects, especially if they were more complex or involved multiple parts.
> - **Type-In Listings**: Another way to refer to the printed code listings in magazines.
> - **Type-In Programs from Magazines**: Emphasizing the source of the code listings.
> - **Type-In Computing**: A broader term that could encompass the entire activity and culture around typing in programs from magazines.

Oh man, stuck on the "type-in" theme there buddy.

GPT4o Bro:

> In the 1980s, when magazines provided code listings for readers to copy and try, this practice and the listings themselves were known by several names, including:
>
> - **Type-in Programs**
> - **Type-in Listings**
> - **Magazine Listings**
> - **Printed Listings**
> - **Listing Programs**
> - **Program Listings**
> - **Code Listings**
> - **DIY Software**
> - **User-Contributed Programs**
> - **Homebrew Code**
> - **Listing Games** (for games specifically)
> - **Copy & Type Software**
> - **Type & Run**
> - **Key-in Programs**
> - **Listing Software**
> - **Type-it-yourself Programs**
>
> These listings appeared in magazines like *Compute!*, *BYTE*, *Creative Computing*, *Your Computer*, *Input*, *RUN Magazine*, and many others. Readers would manually enter the code (often in BASIC or machine language) to run games, utilities, or educational programs on their home computers.

Nice.

I like names that capture the details of the activity, e.g. "_Type & Run_" and "_Printed Listings_" and "_Key-in Programs_".

### Candidate Modern Names?

What are some modern names we can use inspired by all of these?

Chatting with our friends, like:

* Hand-Typed Code
* Code By Hand
* Code-Along Programs
* Keyboard Coding
* Code Copywork

I like names with alteration, or similar. _**Keyboard Coding**_ is really nice.

Maybe _Keyboard Codework_, _Copy Codework_, etc.

### Who Is Still Doing This?

Are there people doing this kind of thing in the modern world with modern languages?

I found [codeguppy](https://codeguppy.com/) has a PDF called "[Draw with Code](https://codeguppy.com/site/download/draw_with_code.pdf)" that has printable pages of (codeguppy-specific) JavaScript for kids to draw pictures.

Found via:

* [JavaScript Type-In programs](https://medium.com/codeguppy/javascript-type-in-programs-d1dd4db5e6f)

Here's an example:

![](/blog/pics/draw-with-code.png)

All credit to them, this is cool!

It's presented as a "deck":

![](/blog/pics/draw-with-code2.webp)

This is sick!

They may have more stuff like this on their site, but I can't find it. It's a complex site and resists my quick-scan skills.

Now imagine a thick hard cover book of one-page pedagogically-tuned Python code listings on standard algorithms.

Clean. Simple. Modern. Fun!?
