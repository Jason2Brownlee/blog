title: 'Eating Operating System'

I fatten quickly when eating carbohydrates.

Not just sweets and ice cream, but bread and pasta.

You might even say I'm carbohydrate intolerant.

I think it's because I was plump as a young kid and I have too many fat cells, especially around the mid section. They're just sitting there all day waiting to grow. Begging.

This is a reminder to myself that my eating operating system is to eat meat and vegetables.

That's it.

* Meat.
* Vegetables.

When cutting, calories should be around 1,000-1,300 kcal/day, and maintenance is around 2,000 kcal/day.

Remember.
