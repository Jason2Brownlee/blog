title: 'Australian English Copy Editing GPT'
---

I have created a custom GPT for copy editing pasted or uploaded text in Australian English.

It includes all of my rules, refined over a ton of books, as well as a simple and terse way of presenting the errors so that can be quickly found and corrected in the original text.

Here it is:

* [Aussie Copy Editor](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68292c5a829c81919c3283d4b5eaa59c-aussie-copy-editor)

Official description:

> An Australian English copy editor that reviews pasted or uploaded text for common errors.

It's also in the GPT marketplace.

Here's the icon I made for it:

If you use it or find it useful, let me know.
