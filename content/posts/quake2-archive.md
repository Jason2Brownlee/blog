title: 'Quake2 Official Release Archive'
---

I created an archive of all official releases for Quake II (Quake2):

* [Quake II Official Archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2OfficialArchive)

It complements my [Quake Official Archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/QuakeOfficialArchive) and [Quake III Arena Official Archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake3OfficialArchive).

It seems that the Quake2 era circa (1998) was perfect for the wayback machine and almost all Quake2 files were archived.

This Quake2 archive is the most complete of the three archives.

The main files missing are a few solaris dedicated server releases, and these may or may not be "official", more research is required.
