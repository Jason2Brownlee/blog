I've been thinking about mini tech books on Quake for about 15 years.

My first google doc of ideas is dated 2010.

I was thinking today, why not develop a "quake press" with a large suite of books over many years.

What kind of books?

All kinds!

* There could be references, e.g. quakec reference, release histories, bsp file format reference, etc.
* There could be code walk throughs, e.g. how do weapons work, monsters, bots, etc.
* There could be mod walk throughs, e.g. reaper, quakeworld, ctf, team fortress, etc.
* There could be interviews, e.g. mod authors, community leaders, mappers, etc.
* There could be tutorials, e.g. weapons, monsters, bots, etc.

Each book could be high quality yet short and sweet (highly targeted), e.g. ~100 pages.

All books pushed for free on the web and put on amazon (kindle and paperback) for those that prefer their own copy.

I don't have to write all the books, I can enlist/hire writers to help.

It could be really fun.

The thing that puts me off is that the audience is perhaps 50-100 people on the planet. No one cares.

After MachineLearningMastery, I'm kind of addicted to having millions of people interested in the material. Not tens of people. I need to get over this.

It could be hobby project, like the quake archives.

Hopefully this post exorcises this idea. Draws out the poison.
