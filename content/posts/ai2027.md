I recommend [reading](https://ai-2027.com/) ([or listening](https://open.spotify.com/show/0pVfkdbpQWM9sKlhzpbQq6)) to **AI 2027**.

Then consume ([watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htOvH12T7mU)/[listen](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2rCc9w5uvDxftS0qd8ShIE)) the most recent episode of the [Dwarkesh podcast](https://www.dwarkesh.com/).

It's a huge amount of work. The site is beautiful. The implications, if accurate, terrible.

The authors are very impressive and Daniel Kokotajlo's [What 2026 looks like](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like) written in 2021 is very impressive (it's probably more than survivorship bias).

Yes, it feels like science fiction in places, but it's all very plausible to (naive) me.

After consuming it all, I'm left a little shell shocked.

Now what?

I need to soak in the ideas for a while.
