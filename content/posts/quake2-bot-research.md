I've been doing research into the release chronology of some Quake2 bots.

This is for the [Quake2 Bot Archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2BotArchive).

Specifically:

* [Famkebot](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2BotArchive/blob/main/research/bots/famkebot.md)
* [C.R.Bot](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2BotArchive/blob/main/research/bots/crbot.md)
* [Eraser Bot](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2BotArchive/blob/main/research/bots/eraser.md)

The idea is to nail down exactly what files were released and when.

This helps when searching, e.g. what files to look for and how to disambiguate multiple releases with the same filename.

It's also a lot of fun.
