title: 'Living Among the Stars'

I am watching the TV Show "[Dune: Prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Prophecy)".

It looks good, is well acted, but the story is thin at best. Nevertheless, it's scifi and my options are few.

It's set 10k years before Dune and some thousands of years from now. Okay...

I was thinking:

> Wow, it would be so very cool if we, our species, can spread out among the stars and cause trouble for tens of thousands of years without killing ourselves off.

It would be so cool.

But it's a daydream. A fantasy.

Everything is too far away. If we can get anywhere nice, there'll be life there. All life is intrinsically hostile to threats like us. We are a threat. Everything close is cold and dangerously irradiated. We'll have to change ourselves dramatically to get by.

I'm no physicists, these are my off the cuff notions, and it's depressing.

"_Spread among the stars_" sounds nice, but it's so very hard to do.

That being said, some version of "[The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series))" universe would be cool enough in the medium term. I hope we can.

Those brilliant authors, along with Andy Weir, have given us a somewhat realistic vision of something "we could do" (perhaps, maybe, at a limit). Something to aim for.
