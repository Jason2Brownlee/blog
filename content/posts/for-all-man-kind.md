I'm watching the TV show "[For All Man Kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_All_Mankind_(TV_series))".

I've finished S1 and I've just started E1 from S2, and it keeps getting better and better.

I can't believe such an awesome show has just been sitting there and it took me 4-5 years to find it, and to then pull the trigger.

It looks like another meh apollo program show, but it's so not.

It's hard scifi + alt history. Win!

It's very well acted and it looks beautiful. Most Apple shows do.

I think the push to consider it came from Geeks Guide. Thank you!
