I finished watching "[A House of Dynamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_House_of_Dynamite)" on Netflix last night.

Oh man. What a movie.

I don't remember being so stressed out watching a movie for a long time. I also don't recall the last time I watched such an "adult" movie.

Thank god. It feels like most of the movies that wash up are for kids/teenagers. It's nice to see something tense and difficult.

Makes me want to go back and watch Zero Dark Thirty (same director) or Sicario (another deeply tense movie).

It looks like it is well received on [Rotten Tomatos](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_house_of_dynamite).
