title: 'Only One Body for Life'

Warren Buffett had a quote along the lines of:

> _if you only had one car for the rest of your how would you look after it..._

It was a thought exercise and analogy for how you should look after your body.

The paraphrase of the quote from chatgp5 is:

> Imagine you had a car and it was the only car you would ever have in your life. You would maintain it carefully and treat it like a treasure. Well, you only get one body and one mind — take care of them.

What the real quote might be (from [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/billionaire-warren-buffett-greatest-advice-to-millennials-the-1-thing-in-life-you-need-to-prioritize.html)):

> "You have only one mind and one body for the rest of your life. [...] If you aren’t taking care of them when you’re young, it’s like leaving that car out in hailstorms and letting rust eat away at it. If you don’t take care of your mind and body now, by the time you’re 40 or 50, you’ll be like a car that can’t go anywhere."

Or this (from [here](https://medium.com/illumination/this-short-speech-from-warren-buffett-changed-my-life-6542f337ac8d)):

> "Let’s just imagine that when we finish, I’m going to let each one of you pick out the car of your choice. Sounds good, doesn’t it?! Pick it out, any color, you name it, it’ll be tied up with a bow, and it’ll be at your house tomorrow, and you might say: ‘Well, what’s the catch?’ And the catch is that it’s the only car you’re ever going to get in your lifetime. Now what are you going to do knowing that’s the only car you’re ever going to have, and you love that car? You’re going to take care of it like you could not believe. Now what I’d like to suggest is that you’re not only going to get one car in your lifetime, but you’re only going to get one body and one mind, that’s all you’re going to get, and that body and mind feels terrific now. But it has to last you a lifetime."

Here's what claude had to say about it:

> Buffett uses this analogy to emphasize the importance of taking care of your physical and mental health, since unlike cars, you can't trade in your body for a new model. It's one of his most memorable pieces of life advice, often shared when he speaks to students or in interviews about living a good life beyond just financial success.

This is good motivation for going to the gym and eating well.

What else?

Great exercise.
