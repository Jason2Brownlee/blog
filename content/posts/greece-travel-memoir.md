title: 'Greece Travel Memoir'
---

I'm preparing for a trip to Greece.

As such, I've been sniffing around for good travel memoirs.

Specifically a memoir or travel log. Not a fictional travel love story. There are zillions on Amazon.

And not just party stories from the islands in the Aegean. Boring.

I picked three:

* [The Colossus of Maroussi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/246.The_Colossus_of_Maroussi), Henry Miller
* [Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/766415.Roumeli), Patrick Leigh Fermor.
* [Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/766421.Mani), Patrick Leigh Fermor.

Why these. A general focus on the mainland, history, and great writing.

Can't wait to dig in.

Also thinking about:

* [Greek to Me: Adventures of the Comma Queen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180076-greek-to-me), Mary Norris.
