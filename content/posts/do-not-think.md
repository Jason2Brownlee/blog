title: 'Do Not Think'
---

Sometimes thinking messes things up.

Specifically things where the thinking was done up front.

I'm talking about situations when you are two selves, the _thinker_ and the _doer_.

The thinker plans it all out the doer just has to execute.

As soon as the doer thinks, it's over. The doer will "think" there way out of the plan and fail to execute.

This is for mechanical things. Habitual things.

- Meal plans
- Gym plans
- Writing plans

And on.

Things where the planner had good ideas about what and when.

Don't question the plans, just get to it.

Sometimes when the doer is trying to think I repeat "_don't think_" over and over as a reminder.
