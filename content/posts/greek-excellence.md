title: 'Greek Excellence'

A nice idea I've come across in my reading of the ancient Greeks is what they call "[Arete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete)".

Perhaps translated as virtue or excellence.

Really it's about striving to be the best version of yourself.

I think I noticed it while reading "[The Last of the Wine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67696.The_Last_of_the_Wine)" by Mary Renault, perhaps when our narrator goes to the Olympics. I could be wrong. I also think it was a theme in the second episode of the [great documentary on the Greeks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5848928/) I [mentioned yesterday](/blog/posts/ancient-greece-timeline/).

Anyway, here's a summary from gpt5.1:

> **Aretē** (ἀρετή) in ancient Greek thought means *excellence*—the fulfillment of one’s highest potential according to one’s nature or purpose. Originally used in Homer to describe heroic strength, courage, and honor, the concept expanded over time to include moral qualities like wisdom, justice, and self-control, especially as Greek society and philosophy developed. For the Greeks, aretē wasn’t simply personal achievement but a lifelong pursuit of becoming one’s best self—physically, mentally, and ethically—through disciplined action and virtuous character. It lay at the heart of Greek education (*paideia*), guided athletic and civic life, and became a major theme in philosophy from Socrates to Aristotle. In essence, **aretē is the ideal of human excellence that leads to a flourishing, well-lived life.**

I like the idea and I try to drill this into my kids (myself?), to no avail.

Hmm, rather than excellence, I'm more of a "follow your curiosity and obsess about a topic" kind of guy.

Do the Greeks have a word/philosophy for that?

Perhaps:

* Philomathia (φιλομαθία): "Love of learning"

Combined with:

* Mania (μανία): "Inspired frenzy or obsessive drive"

How about:

* **Philomania** (φιλομανία) — "Love-driven obsession with learning"
