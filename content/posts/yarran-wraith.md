I have published another horror novella for my eldest.

I think he's enjoying them, it's hard to tell.

This one is titled:

* **The Yarran Wraith**

It's set in bushland that I grew up playing in.

It's epistolary with emails and journal entries as well as sketches and photos of what our main character found in the bush.

Here's the cover:

Here's the blurb:

> Stay out of Yarran Dheran Reserve.
>
> In the quiet suburb of Donvale, Melbourne, thirteen-year-old Riley Harper seeks solace in the wild beauty of Yarran Dheran Reserve, a bushland haven teeming with native wildlife and winding trails. But when a routine walk leads him to a strange, moss-covered sinkhole hidden deep in the forest, everything changes. The air grows unnaturally silent, the shadows shift, and an unsettling presence seems to watch from the trees. As Riley documents his discovery in frantic journal entries and haunting sketches, his once-vibrant spirit begins to unravel, leaving his mother, Claire, desperate for answers.
>
> What lies at the heart of the sinkhole, and why does it call to Riley with such relentless force? As his fascination deepens, the line between reality and nightmare blurs, pulling his family into a chilling mystery that defies explanation. The Yarran Wraith is a gripping, atmospheric tale of suspense and dread, where the beauty of the Australian bush conceals secrets that may be better left undisturbed. Perfect for readers who crave a haunting blend of coming-of-age drama and unsettling mystery.
