title: 'First Serious PC'
---

This is a nostalgia piece.

I worked at a pizza shop in high-school.

I used the money to buy my first PC in 1996. I was 15, in year 9, I was obsessed with Quake (quake 1) and the PC was a Intel 133mhz.

We had "family" PCs before this, but this one was mine alone. Purchased with money I earned through hard/gross labor.

My first "serious" PC was about a year later. I was 16, still working in the pizza shop and in year 10 at high school.

I saved my money and purchased the an [Intel Pentium 266mhz MMX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/49968/intel-pentium-processor-with-mmx-technology-266-mhz-66-mhz-fsb/specifications.html).

I hand picked every aspect of the machine, such as:

* The amount and brand of RAM.
* The specific motherboard.
* The specific speed and brand of CD ROM.

And on.

Most importantly, the video cards.

The reason for the upgrade one year later was because the 3d-accelerated revolution had begin and [Quake 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II) (with colored lighting!) was about to be released.

From Wikipedia:

> Unlike Quake, where hardware acceleration was only implemented through later patches, Quake II was released with native OpenGL support.

The primary video card was [Matrox Mystique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrox_Mystique).

It could do some basic 3D by itself and was perhaps the king of primary video cards at the time.

Here's a pic of the box:

The shining light of this new box was my [3dfx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx) accelerator card.

I got the **Diamond Monster 3D 3dfx Voodoo1 4 MB PCI**, with the external pass-through cable.

Here's the card itself:

Before Quake II came out in late 1997, there were only a handful of 3dfx supported games to play.

When I got the rig up and running I played GLQuake with glowing rockets. I never went back to software rendered quake.

I purchased [shadows of the empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Shadows_of_the_Empire_(video_game)) because it had 3dfx support an amazing opening set piece of tripping ATATs with a tow cable from the battle of hoth.

I played other 3d-accelerated games around this time, but I don't really recall what they were.

(_searching..._)

Okay, I recall playing titles with 3dfx/glide support like:

* MechWarrior 2
* Descent 2
* Blood
* MDK
* Need for Speed II SE
* Tomb Raider

I specifically recall Turok had great graphics (fog! bow and arrow!) and I played it a lot because of that - the gameplay itself was so so.

Eventually, Quake II game out in December 1997.

I played it in 3dfx mode with colored lighting, smooth pixels, see-through water, and all was good with the world.

I think my next PC after this was an [Intel Celeron 300A](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/27183/intel-celeron-processor-300-mhz-128k-cache-66-mhz-fsb/specifications.html), overclocked to 450Mhz.

Good times.
