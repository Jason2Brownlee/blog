title: 'My PC History'
---

I read "[Building my childhood dream PC](https://fabiensanglard.net/2168/)" by fabiensanglard and shared in his nostalgia for his childhood dream PC.

So cool.

I'm trying to remember by PCs. It's really hard.

Here's a first draft of my PC history:

* XT or 286 (?), Dad's, early 1990s to about 1993.
* 486 DX2/66 (?), Family's, 1995-ish?
* Pentium 133Mhz, My first PC, circa 1996
* Pentium 266Mhz MMX, [Upgrade + 3DFX](/blog/posts/first-serious-pc/), circa 1997
* Celeron 300A @450Mhz, [Gaming box](https://web.archive.org/web/20000601155757fw_/http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/pc.html), circa 1999
* AMD 1.?Ghz, Some kind of AMD and GForce video card?, circa 2000-2004
* Apple iBook, sold everything for a laptop, circa 2005-2008.
* Apple iMac, first imac, 2008-2017
* Apple iMac, Current Workstation, circa 2017-present

Some details are solid, because I have hard evidence. Other's less so,

I remember the first family PC was probably an XT, but could have been upgraded to a 286. It was the machine where I played a ton of wolf3d, commander keen, and all the 1980s and early 90s games.

I remember sometimes after the launch of Windows 95, we got a new family PC. Probably 1995 or 1996. It was our first multimedia PC. It ran Win95, it had a 16-bit sound card, our first CD-ROM, and 4MB RAM. I remember. we upgraded to 6 MB RAM at one point and I could finally play dark forces. I also remember [Encarta 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta) and playing around a lot with midi files. Also games like Doom and [Heretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic_(video_game)) with cool sound.

My first PC, purchased with my own hard earned money was a big deal. A 33.6 modem, microsoft joystick, and on. Lots of Mechwarrior 2, doom, duke3d, Quake, and on.

Shortly after was the upgrade to a truly awesome gaming machine with 3DFX. I documented some of this already [here](/blog/posts/first-serious-pc/).  This was probably 1996 or 1997.

I remember that around the time of my first and second PC, I had many other lesser PCs in my room. Mostly 286 and 386 machines running Linux or Windows 3.1 in a little LAN. I was learning about networking and needed test machines. This was probably 1997 or 1998.

In university I upgraded to a Celeron 300A @450Mhz, and a record of the whole machine [was captured online](https://web.archive.org/web/20000601155757fw_/http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Tower/8163/pc.html). I have no memory of a "Diamond Viper" Nvidia card. I was big into Linux and I do remember spending a ton of hours trying to get OpenGL and USB working right for gaming in Linux. It was a debugging puzzle more than a requirement. A technical challenge.

The next upgrade is fuzzy. I remember it was a big machine with lots of fans and a large copper heat sink. It was probably over 1Ghz but I don't remember anything about it, really. I do remember selling it to a friend in my research group around 2004 or 2005. At the time I was doing a PhD and had an assigned workstation and access to fast servers for running experiments. I was living in a share house and had no need for a home PC. I lived in the lab, basically.

I eventually got a tiny 12" [iBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook), for some at-home running on rails dev, and other stuff. It was tiny, white and I really loved it. This was my big switch from Linux to MacOS. I sitll used Linux at work for a long time.

Eventually the ibook got too slow and I got a 27" iMac with 4 cores, I guess some kind of i7. I had that for a decade at least before upgrading to another identical machine with all faster new internals (SSD, i7 etc).

I don't even know the details of my current workstation, it doesn't matter. If I need to run something fast or use GPUs, I get an ec2 box. And I don't game, other than some Quake now and then.

Man I loved that ibook. It was not item, so probably powerpc. It was probably less than 1Ghz too.

Here's a pic of what it looked like:

Good times.
