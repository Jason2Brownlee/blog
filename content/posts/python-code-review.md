title: 'Python Code Review Custom GPT'
---

I built a simple custom GPT for Python code review.

Mainly for my algorithm and data structure implementations for [the thing described here](/blog/posts/code-simple-algorithms-datastructures/).

Here it is:

* [Python Code Reviewer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6840f0348c14819190f6a7b8f8fc3350-python-code-reviewer): Suggest improvements to your pasted Python code

Here's the logo I made for it:
