title: 'Visions of Greece'

I've been sniffing around for documentaries on Greece.

I've watched a few, and they're fun.

I found one on Prime video called "[Visions of Greece](https://www.amazon.com/Visions-of-Greece-Season-1/dp/B01KPCLFAQ)" (2003).

Here's the blurb:

> A beautiful virtual tour that lifts off from Athens, and embarks on an odyssey as varied and dramatic as Greek history, exploring islands scattered like stones in the blue Aegean, ancient ruins, verdant hills, rocky coastlines, and timeless traditions. The dramatic view is enhanced by a soundtrack of traditional and modern Greek music and a narrative that celebrates Greek history and mythology.

It's two episodes of helicopter footage from all across Greece with a few title cards and a little narration now and then with some gentle Greek music in the background.

It's beautiful, and relaxing, and a little inspirational.

I see sights I recognise and say to myself "I'm going there".
