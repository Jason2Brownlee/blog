title: 'First Draft'

The first draft is just the beginning.

A short stop before the real work begins.

And the first draft is no good. It's complete shit.

> The first draft of anything is shit

-- Ernest Hemingway

The first draft only captures the first ideas. You're not done. Far from it.

Read it, just five things wrong with it, fix those five things, repeat.

Repeat until you run out of time or you get sick of it.

The work is iterative refinement. Editing.

There is no "second draft", or "third draft". The idea of discrete versions of the work is completely arbitrary. You fix a big thing and you can call the version anything you want.

The best ideas for "fixing the problems" will probably come when you're away from the work. While going for a walk. While having a shower.

Implement the fixes as soon as you can. Run. They too are "first drafts" and will benefit from iterative refinement.

Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.
