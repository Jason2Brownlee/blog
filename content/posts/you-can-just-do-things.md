title: 'You Can Just Do Things'
---

I read Jay Yang's "[You Can Just Do Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232411933-you-can-just-do-things)".

Good book, good stories, and good reminder.

Importantly, I purchased a physical copy for my eldest.

I'm hoping it inspires him. And, it is a good reminder to keep buying him books along these lines. Something will hit.
