title: 'LLM + Evolutionary Search'
---

I tripped over another LLM + Evolutionary search post yesterday on HN:

* [OpenEvolve: Teaching LLMs to Discover Algorithms Through Evolution](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46211861) (news.ycombinator.com)
* [OpenEvolve: Teaching LLMs to Discover Algorithms Through Evolution](https://algorithmicsuperintelligence.ai/blog/openevolve-overview/index.html) (algorithmicsuperintelligence.ai)

I like this area of research. It's an area I'd dig into, if I was compelled to do research.

I've touched on this before: [AlphaEvolve](/blog/posts/alphaevolve/) and [LLM Prompt Optimization](/blog/posts/llm-prompt-optimization/) and perhaps others.

What is this field of study called? No consensus yet.

What are the main (popular) projects?

I suspect projects like:

* AlphaEvolve (google)
	* [AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/)
	* [AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/AlphaEvolve.pdf?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=), White Paper.
	* [AlphaEvolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaEvolve), Wikipedia.
* OpenEvolve (algorithmic super intelligence)
	* [OpenEvolve](https://github.com/algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve), GitHib.
	* [OpenEvolve: Teaching LLMs to Discover Algorithms Through Evolution](https://algorithmicsuperintelligence.ai/blog/openevolve-overview/index.html)
* AlphaResearch (bytedance)
	* [AlphaResearch: Accelerating New Algorithm Discovery with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.08522v1)
* ShinkaEvolve (sakanaai)

* CALM
	* [CALM: Co-evolution of Algorithms and Language Model for Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12285), Paper

And many others.

It's a mix, some are focused on algorithm-gen, others paper/discovery-gen. I may be mixing things too much here.

Perhaps the taxonomy in this (older) survey helps:

* [LLM4EC: Interdisciplinary Research on LLM and Evolutionary Computation](https://github.com/wuxingyu-ai/LLM4EC)
	* [Evolutionary Computation in the Era of Large Language Model: Survey and Roadmap](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767756), paper.
