title: 'Solid Project For Web Decentralization'

I finished Tim Berners-Lee's autobiography yesterday:

* [This Is for Everyone: The Unfinished Story of the World Wide Web](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222376492-this-is-for-everyone)

The description early years was good.

The latter part of the book was a push for his [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

More here:

* [Solid (web decentralization project), Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(web_decentralization_project))

It sounds like something like this (private date wallet) is a good idea. Maybe even this approach.
