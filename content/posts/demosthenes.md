title: 'Demosthenes'
---

Building on yesterdays dig into [Phaedrus](/blog/posts/phaedrus/) from "_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_", I was thinking of ancient Greeks in other books I've re-read many times.

I came up with "[Demosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosthenes)" from "[Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game)".

Ender's brother and sister stir things up on the "socials" of the day and eventually his brother becomes some kind of world leader.

The sister posts the brothers view as "Demosthenes" and the brother posts the sisters view a [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke), as a check on each other.

So, here's a sketch of Demosthenes gpt5.1:

> Demosthenes (384–322 BCE) was one of ancient Greece’s greatest orators and a leading Athenian statesman during the city’s turbulent decline in the 4th century BCE. Known for his powerful, carefully crafted speeches, he became famous for denouncing the expanding power of Philip II of Macedon in a series of works called the *Philippics*. Despite a speech impediment in youth, he trained relentlessly to master rhetoric, eventually becoming Athens’ most influential voice for democracy and resistance. Although his political efforts ultimately failed as Macedon gained dominance, Demosthenes’ speeches remain landmark examples of classical rhetoric, celebrated for their clarity, passion, and patriotic conviction.

And major works:

* **The Philippics** – A series of speeches warning Athens about the threat posed by Philip II of Macedon.
* **The Olynthiacs** – Three speeches urging Athens to aid the city of Olynthus against Philip II.
* **On the Crown** – His most famous speech, defending his political career and attacking Aeschines; considered a masterpiece of Greek rhetoric.
* **Against Meidias** – A legal speech demonstrating his skill in courtroom oratory.
* **Self-trained orator** – Overcame a childhood speech impediment through intense practice (e.g., speaking with pebbles in his mouth, reciting while running).
* **Leading statesman of Athens** – Served as a prominent advocate for Athenian democracy and resistance against Macedonian dominance.
* **Diplomatic efforts** – Played key roles in Athenian alliances and negotiations, including opposition to the Peace of Philocrates.
* **Symbol of Athenian resistance** – Even after defeat at Chaeronea, he worked to rally Greek resistance until his final flight from Macedonian pursuit.

And on the use of Demosthenes as a device in Ender's Game:

> In *Ender’s Game*, **“Demosthenes” is not the ancient orator himself but a deliberate literary device**: the pseudonym used by Valentine Wiggin as she and her brother Peter shape global political discourse through online essays. Choosing the name “Demosthenes” is symbolic and strategic. The historical Demosthenes was a fierce defender of Athenian democracy and a master rhetorician who warned against rising threats; in the novel, Valentine’s “Demosthenes” similarly adopts a passionate, nationalistic voice meant to provoke public reaction and influence geopolitics. The pseudonym lends *credibility*, evoking the authority of a great classical orator, while also allowing Valentine to inhabit a persona radically different from her own personality—fiery, combative, and opinionated. This contrast highlights the novel’s theme of **identity as performance**, as well as the power of language in shaping society. Additionally, by pairing “Demosthenes” with Peter’s more conservative pseudonym “Locke,” Orson Scott Card creates an echo of Enlightenment and classical debate, using the two voices to explore how public opinion can be engineered by rhetoric rather than truth.

And:

> Here’s why the name matters:
>
> **1. Demosthenes symbolizes fiery, populist resistance**
>
> The real Demosthenes was famous for passionate speeches warning Athens about the growing power of Philip II of Macedon. He was a nationalist voice pushing people to resist foreign influence.
> Valentine’s “Demosthenes” persona mimics this—fiery, emotional, and suspicious of international (especially Russian) dominance.
>
> **2. The goal is shaping Earth’s political landscape, not attacking Ender**
>
> Peter and Valentine create two rhetorical poles—
>
> * **Locke**: calm, reasoned, moderate (Peter)
> * **Demosthenes**: aggressive, alarmist, nationalist (Valentine)
>
> They use these voices to steer global opinion so that **Peter can eventually take political power**. Their aim: position themselves as leaders in the world *after* the Bugger War.
>
> **3. The Demosthenes persona is designed to provoke**
>
> Valentine as Demosthenes takes radical stances to:
>
> * stir debate
> * energize nationalist movements
> * create tension that Locke (Peter) can then “reasonably” calm
>   This rhetorical conflict helps Peter appear like the sensible unifier needed for future leadership.
>
> **4. It indirectly relates to Ender only in showing contrast**
>
> While Ender fights an alien war unknowingly, Peter and Valentine fight an ideological war on Earth.
> The Demosthenes persona isn’t aimed at Ender, but it highlights how **words can be as powerful as armies**, a major theme of the book.

Nice!

I should have done that digging years ago as well.
