title: 'I Love Small Technical Handbooks'
---

I saw this on HN this morning:

* [Show HN: I wrote a modern Command Line Handbook](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44126612)

It's currently number 3 with 63 comments and 245 upvotes.

Nice!

It's for a book on [how to use the command line](https://commandline.stribny.name/) on the big 3 OS.

It's a short, focused, basic handbook.

I love those.

I love making those.

And I'm so happy that the tech community is still supporting them. And interesting in them.

I should make more of these myself, and just give them all away. Like [Algorithm Afternoon](https://algorithmafternoon.com/), but more systematic.

Things he did right: friendly non-marketing language in the post, simple cover, sample chapter link, pay what you want gumroad link.

Things that could be better:

- Paperback, kindle, etc. formats (e.g. pandoc)
- Link to amazon (kindle, paperback)
- Read online version (e.g. hugo book)
- Pictures from within the book on the landing page
- Donate button
- Email address to chat/get comments/feedback.

People want to help and support, offer them ways, even a few links down the bottom of the page.

I should do this again.

Pick a tiny technical topic and bang out a solid handbook.
