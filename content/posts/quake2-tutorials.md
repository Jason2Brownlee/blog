title: 'Quake2 Programming Tutorials'
---

As part of my [Quake 2 Bot Archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2BotArchive) project, I've been doing research into old quake bot websites.

I gather the research in markdown so I can re-trace my steps later, and also for good file provenance and complete mod coverage for the archive.

For example:

* [Quake II Bot Research](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2BotArchive/blob/main/research/bots/README.md)

Anyway, this lead into into capturing links to old collections of Quake2 mod tutorials and bot tutorials.

For example:

* [Quake II Code Tutorials](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake2BotArchive/blob/main/research/bots/resource_tutorials.md)

Damn it.

* Now I'm thinking that it would be fun to code up some simple quake2 mods. Maybe with the original code base. Maybe for the re-release code base.
* Then I'm thinking of writing my own tutorials.
* Then writing a technical monograph on how to mod quake2 for nostalgia reasons.
* Then writing tutorials on how to code a bot from scratch.
* Then tutorials on explaining how existing monsters work and how third party bots from back in the day work.

Oh man.

This would be fun, but it's a lot. A big project and lots of hard work. For what? An audience of myself and (just maybe) a few other quake2-modder old timers.

I don't know.

Then again, the mantra of side projects should be:

> _make stuff you want to exist in the world..._

Self, if you do this, start small. Insanely small.
