I just finished a re-read of "[The Shadow of the Torturer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60211.The_Shadow_of_the_Torturer)".

It was better this time around. I guess I was more ready for it. I gave it 3 stars, but perhaps by the time I finish the series, I will up that. Perhaps it will join my annual re-read rotation? We'll see...

The first time I read it, I did not finish. Too slow, too boring. Don't care. Also, it felt like a fantasy. It's not, it's clever scifi dressed as fantasy. Yay!

I gave the book more of a chance this time. It is still very slow, but I appreciate the language more.

Here's a plot summary from gpt4.5:

> *The Shadow of the Torturer*, by Gene Wolfe, follows Severian, an apprentice torturer in the Citadel of Nessus. After showing mercy by secretly aiding a prisoner, he is exiled from his guild. Armed with the executioner's sword, Terminus Est, Severian journeys through a decaying world beneath a dying sun, encountering strange companions and ancient relics. The novel blends fantasy, science fiction, and philosophical reflection as Severian navigates moral dilemmas and mysterious forces, beginning a path toward eventual rulership.

Spoilers chatgpt!!

Severian is a great name!

I liked the stuff in the citadel. I liked the plot against him by the brother and sister and the execution.

The end was fast and confusing. What happened exactly?

LLMs resist telling me. I asked a few and got wildly different answers. And some serious hallucinations.

* The gem (The Claw of the Conciliator) saved him in the dual.
* The play had some meaning too I guess.

Oh well.

I'm working my way through the whole series.

I've been told the "[The Book of the New Sun Series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41474-the-book-of-the-new-sun)" is an epic like lord of the rings. Okay, let's see.

They're not fat books, very reasonably sized, but I have to be awake when reading them. The language is thick. Literary.

Next up, The [Claw of the Conciliator](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/463376.The_Claw_of_the_Conciliator).
