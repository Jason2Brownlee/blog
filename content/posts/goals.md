title: 'Goals'

Normally, I'm a "[systems over goals](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)" kind of guy.

Nevertheless, sometimes having a goal kicks ass.

It cuts through everything with questions like:

* Will reading this get me closer?
* Will doing this get me closer?
* What's one thing I can do to get closer?

I'm not saying "_goals over systems_".

I'm still a systems guy. I'll _system_ my way all the way up and over the goal.

Just sometimes, we need a sharp knife to cut away the cruft and a crisp goal can be that knife.

* Focus
* Direction
* Measured Performance
* Time management
* Motivation

All that good stuff.
