title: 'Discipline Coding (opposite of vibe coding)'

Every movement has a counter or opposite movement.

The opposite of vibe coding?

Let's call it: "_Discipline Coding_".

---

## **Tenets**

1. **Self-Reliance over Delegation**

   * *Belief*: If you didn’t write it, you don’t truly understand it.
   * *Practice*: Hand-roll core algorithms, avoid generated code, and limit dependencies.

2. **Deliberate over Emergent**

   * *Belief*: Good code isn’t discovered in a “vibe,” it’s designed with intention.
   * *Practice*: Careful planning, diagrams, upfront modeling before writing a line of code.

3. **Transparency over Black Box**

   * *Belief*: Every line of code should be understandable by its author, with no opaque AI decisions.
   * *Practice*: Strive for codebases small enough to be “held in the head.” No mysterious scaffolding.

4. **Mastery over Velocity**

   * *Belief*: Efficiency is secondary to skill and depth. True programmers master fundamentals.
   * *Practice*: Relearn data structures, algorithms, parsers, compilers—*from scratch*.

5. **Constraint over Convenience**

   * *Belief*: Constraints (time, language limitations, avoiding AI) lead to deeper creativity.
   * *Practice*: Coding challenges that intentionally *avoid* shortcuts: “no frameworks,” “no AI,” “just C.”

6. **Craft over Commodity**

   * *Belief*: Code is not just utility—it is an expressive medium and a craft.
   * *Practice*: Elegance and beauty in code is valued more than shipping velocity.

## **What They Do**

* Write everything themselves (algorithms, data structures, even small runtimes).
* Participate in “code kata” or “from scratch” challenges.
* Publish *hand-written* projects as counterpoints to AI-spawned sprawl.
* Value *readable notebooks, literate programming, and proofs* over quick hacks.
* Treat programming like woodworking or calligraphy—*slow, precise, joyful*.

## **What They Reject**

* Auto-generated scaffolding they can’t fully audit.
* Reliance on autocomplete / copilots as the *primary* coding mode.
* Sprawling, complex codebases that only AI can manage.
* “Vibes” as a design principle—favoring rigor, discipline, and forethought instead.

Yes, I did develop this with gpt5... of course.

I think this will be a thing, I will participate, but I'm not a fanatic.

Here's a cool pic:
