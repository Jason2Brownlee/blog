There's a scene in [Authority](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077769-authority) that freaks out most who read it (as evidence on [r/SouthernReach](https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthernReach/)).

Its in Chapter "03: Break Down".

The "Whitby" scene.

Oh man.

"Control", our protagonist has climb up into the roof cavity in the store room of their large scientific installation next to the southern reach.

He's found a horrible mural panted on a wall up there with the faces of the staff. He's also found a sleeping bag like someone is spending a lot of time up there.

Control suspects it's Whitby. The mild mannered scientist whose been acting really strange of late.

> ...On the floor opposite him, near the right-hand shelves, a trowel, a selection of paints, a stand that allowed Whitby to reach the ceiling. A few books. A portable stove. A sleeping bag, bundled up. Had Whitby been living here?

Then...!

Standing there, he then realizes he can feel breath on the back of his neck.

WTF!

> ...Control had been standing there with his back to the shelves for only about a minute.
>
> He had been standing there recognizing that there was a draft in the loft. He had been standing there without realizing that it wasn't a draft.
>
> Someone was breathing, behind him.
>
> Someone was breathing on his neck. The knowledge froze him, froze the cry of “Jesus fuck!” in his throat.”

It's that "“Jesus fuck!".

Right on.

It's Whitby.

> ...Sitting in the bookshelf. There the entire time. Silent. Waiting. Watching.
>
> Whitby, who had been there the entire time, crammed into the shelf right behind Control, at eye level, bent at the knees, on his side.
>
> Breathing in shallow sharp bursts. Staring out.
>
> Like something incubating. There, on the shelf.

Now, Whitby's not a physical thread.

He's no psycho killer.

But he's a fucking lunatic for just sitting in a bookshelf. Watching.

And then:

> ...Then there was a slight movement and Whitby's hand came to rest on the back of his head. Just resting there, palm flat against Control's hair. The fingers spread like a starfish and slowly moved back and forth. Two strokes. Three. Petting Control's head. Caressing it in a gentle, tentative way.
>
> Control remained still. It took an effort.

God fucking damn it.

Anyway.

Read the book.

Read the series.

Read the new one (Absolution) with lots more Whitby in it.
