title: 'Pushback to Vibe Coding?'
---

I have been thinking about what the push-back to vibe coding will look like.

Rather than:

> "do everything for me, and do it right now"

The sentiment might be something like:

> "do everything myself, and take my time"

Along these lines, I was thinking a "_code from scratch series_".

A swing toward _discipline_, _mastery_, and _minimalism_.

For example:

> I'm a serious programmer, not a vibe coder. I coded this massive thing from scratch in ansi c with no dependencies other than stdlib and here are the 300 hours of video on youtube proving it.

or:

> I'm a human-first programmer. I produce artisanal code written by humans and intended to be read by other humans.

I have had this thought before, last year:

- [Algorithm Afternoon](https://algorithmafternoon.com/) (circa 2024)

And again a month or two ago:

- [Code Simple Algorithms and Data Structures (from scratch for fun)](/blog/posts/code-simple-algorithms-datastructures/)
- [Which Algorithms Data Structures?](/blog/posts/which-algorithms-data-structures/)

We have experienced pushback movements in our field before.

- extreme programming/agile/tdd in response to software specs/waterfall (circa 1999-2005)
- ruby/meta programming/programming craft in response to corporate java/.net verbosity (2007-2014)

We will see a push back, but what form will it take?

And can I help? Can I be apart of it?

Some kind of [slow code](/blog/posts/hand-crafted-code/) or "code from scratch press" or "[code by copying](/blog/posts/code-that/) or [code copywork](/blog/posts/code-copywork/)? I've been thinking on this all year its seems... :)

But also...

One might also take the other side.

That is: push harder in the vibe coding direction.

It _is_ awesome, after all.

A year ago we didn't have a name for it, but we were doing it and talking about it. I was calling it stuff like "[chat-driven programming](/blog/posts/chat-driven-programming/)" and devs I was talking to last year could not grok why/how it would ever be a thing.

Now we have a name, more people are coming to it every day, technical and not.

And many programmers do love it, see this from today:

* [Ask HN: Did modern AI's coding abilities make you lose interest in programming?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45040225)

It will be fascinating how this "efficiency vs craft" pendulum swing will pan out.

For craft, the joy is in knowing, not just shipping.

Hand-written code as poetry? As flex? As identity? Retro?
