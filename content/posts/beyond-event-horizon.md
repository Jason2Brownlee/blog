title: 'Beyond the Event Horizon'

I just tripped over a [cute tweet](https://x.com/sama/status/1896653628674625812) by sama + gpt4.5.

He was asking if we are close to the singularity.

GPT4.5 responded, yes, and that we are already beyond the event horizon.

The rationale is that AI is already influencing human thought, creativity, communication, and identity.

Good reasoning. I agree.

But by that reasoning, the slow ramp started decades ago.
