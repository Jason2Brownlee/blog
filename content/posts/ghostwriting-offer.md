title: 'Crafting a (Ghostwriting) Offer'
---

I'm finishing up my read through of "[The Art & Business Of Ghostwriting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192252103-the-art-business-of-ghostwriting)" by [Nicolas Cole](https://www.nicolascole.com).

The best chapter is Chapter. 16: **_Crafting Your Irresistible Ghostwriting Offer(3 Key Components)_**.

It's a great book. I don't want to ghostwrite, but there's really good advice in there and it's well written.

Anyway, Chapter 16 has a framework for crafting an offer. Not new, much like the material from [Russell Brunson](https://x.com/russellbrunson) and [Alex Hormozi](https://x.com/AlexHormozi), but it's well presented.

There's three steps: 1) positioning, 2) problem-solution, and 3) exchange (or something).

> I believe all Irresistible Offers (intentionally or unintentionally) are actually built from these combined skill sets, consisting of the following 3 components:
>
> * A new, named & claimed category
> * An articulate, specific list of problems, solutions, benefits, and outcomes
> * And a no-brainer exchange of either value for money, problem for effort, or outcome for time”

It's all explained quickly. My engineering brain wants more framework/templates and less stories.

Anyway, here's my grasp of the steps:

## Step 1: Positioning

I've read the Al Ries and Jack Trout book on [positioning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/760025.Positioning), but Cole and his "category pirates" do a damn fine job of presenting the concept (e.g. [Snow Leopard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61772680-snow-leopard)).

They did positioning on "positioning", calling it "category design", a term they invented and are experts in, they "named and claimed". Win!

This chapter has a terse summary of these ideas.

The starting point is the [rules of ones](/blog/posts/rule-of-ones/):

* 1 Specific Problem
* 1 Specific Person
* 1 Specific Way

Take this triad and give it a simple descriptive name.

This will be your positioning, your "category of one".

The great example in the book is "_health benefit marketing_" for a writer who helps brand educate customers on the health benefits of their products".

I love it! The specificity of the name.

## Step 2: Problem-Solution

This is classic copywriting.

Define the problem and the negative impact, then define the solution and positive impact.

> There are two “narratives” the client needs to understand (and be able to clearly & viscerally imagine) in order to believe your Irresistible Offer works:
>
> * Specific Problem » Reason Why » Consequence of Problem » Ultimate Negative Outcome
> * Specific Solution » Reason Why » Benefit of Solution » Ultimate Positive Outcome

This is not persuasion.

This is educating the client/reader.

> No persuasion. No comparison conversation. No having to convince the client that you’re better or faster or cheaper than the next person. Just a helpful articulation of the problem and the benefits of solving it.”

It's too compact, there's a lot to unpack here.

Maybe a table (via gpt4o) will help:

| Narrative            | Step                         | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Problem Narrative** | **Specific Problem**       | Clearly define the exact issue the client faces. |
|                      | **Reason Why**             | Explain why this problem exists and persists. |
|                      | **Consequence of Problem** | Detail the direct negative effects of the problem. |
|                      | **Ultimate Negative Outcome** | Show the worst-case scenario if the problem is not solved. |
| **Solution Narrative** | **Specific Solution**      | Present the exact solution you provide. |
|                      | **Reason Why**             | Explain why your solution works effectively. |
|                      | **Benefit of Solution**    | Highlight the immediate positive impact of using the solution. |
|                      | **Ultimate Positive Outcome** | Paint the picture of the best possible outcome for the client. |


## Step 3: Exchange

This is about the exchange of value in the offer.

I give you this, you give me that.

Here's the quote:

> There are 3 “trades” all customers and clients on planet earth want:
>
> * Insane value for a minimal relative cost
> * Urgent & painful problem solved for minimal effort
> * Highly desirable outcome, generated instantly”

Here's my paraphrase:

* I give you insane value and it's well prices compared to the alternative of you doing it manually.
* I solve this problem for and you don't have to do much.
* I give you the thing you want badly right now.

Let's try and male this a table (with our gpt friend):


| What I Offer                         | What You Get                          |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Insane value at a well-priced cost  | High value without overspending     |
| Problem solved with minimal effort  | Issue resolved with ease            |
| Instant access to a desirable outcome | What you want, right now           |

This is a great framework.

My favorite part is the positioning.

No one does this, or if they do, they don't do it well.

It's hard I guess.

I need to re-read the category pirates books, e.g. "[The 22 Laws of Category Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157555853-the-22-laws-of-category-design)".

Maybe I should read "[Becoming a Category of One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1590116.Becoming_a_Category_of_One)" by Joe Calloway.

From his book:

> Don’t strive to be a leader in your category. Create a differ- ent category, and be the only one in it. That’s the idea behind Becoming a Category of One.
