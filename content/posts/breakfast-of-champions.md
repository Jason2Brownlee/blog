I finished [Breakfast of Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_of_Champions) by Kurt Vonnegut yesterday.

Not sure what I read. It was a fun, I guess, and a little unstable.

Yes, I could see the subtext of American consumer automatons. But there was too much bad language and sex to no real effect (i.e. delete it and it has the same story/message).

Gave me vibes of [Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest). The pithy short sentences. The "and so on's". The narrator getting involved (e.g. metafiction).

I've read other Vonnegut novels in the past, a long time ago, and don't recall them being this strange. Perhaps they were.
