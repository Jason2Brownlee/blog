title: 'Quake3 Official Archive'

Since posting the [q3test versions](/blog/posts/q3-test-versions/) there's been some interest in a Quake III Arena official archive.

I pitched doing the same thing as the [Quake Official Archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/QuakeOfficialArchive).

So, it's begun, here it is:

* [Quake3 Official Archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/Quake3OfficialArchive)

I've added all the q3test versions, point releases, source releases and tools.

Lots of mopping up to do, which will likely takes weeks to months, if not years.

Fun!
