title: 'Schoolwork as Reps'
---

My son made the comment about his school work that all kids make at some point:

> This is boring. Why do I have to do this? I'm never going to use it!

I think it was with regard to some math homework.

So, we had "**the talk**" about schoolwork.

I stared off talking about the morning exercises he and his brother do with me:

* Star-jumps
* Push-ups
* Sit-ups
* Squats

I said something like:

> The morning exercises we do are movements we are **never going to use**, right? But they make our bodies stronger for the actual things we want to do like sports and to have a better/more useful body in general.

We do the daily reps (repetitions).

They're boring.

We are never going to use them.

But they have a point.

Then I said:

> The same with most schoolwork. It is boring. You're (very likely) never going to use it directly, but it has a point. It makes your mind "stronger" for the things you want to do now and later.

**Schoolwork is like _reps for your mind_**.

Maybe it's base knowledge you can build upon later with stuff you want to do.

Maybe it's the skill of study, learning, and problem solving you can use on something interesting later.

Also, very rarely, you will actually trip over a topic at school that really lights you up.

Not sure if any of this "got in", it may have bounced off.

This very argument may require more reps :)

Then I was thinking, does the school ever have this talk with them? Level with them?

Probably not.

Are there resources "out there" that make this argument for the kids?

Not that I can find? Google keeps pushing me towards "school representatives" whatever that is.

From our friend deepseek (lightly edited):

> **The "Reps for Life" Perspective**
>    - **Skill Development**: School work often focuses on building foundational skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, time management, and discipline. These are transferable skills that are valuable in almost any career or life situation, even if the specific content (e.g., algebra, history dates) isn’t directly used.
>    - **Mental Resilience**: Completing assignments, studying for tests, and meeting deadlines can be seen as "reps" for handling responsibilities, stress, and challenges in adulthood. It’s less about the content and more about the process of learning how to learn and persevere.
>    - **Exposure to Diverse Subjects**: School introduces students to a wide range of subjects, which helps them discover their interests and strengths. Even if someone doesn’t use calculus later, they might discover a passion for math, engineering, or logic-based fields because of their exposure to it.
>
> **The "I Will Never Use This" Argument**
>    - **Relevance of Content**: It’s true that not every specific topic taught in school will be directly applicable to every student’s future career or life. For example, not everyone will need to know the details of the French Revolution or how to solve quadratic equations.
>    - **Practical Skills Gap**: Some argue that schools could do a better job of teaching practical life skills, such as financial literacy, emotional intelligence, or hands-on vocational training, which are more directly applicable to "real life."
>    - **Engagement and Motivation**: When students don’t see the relevance of what they’re learning, they may become disengaged. This is a valid critique of traditional education systems, which sometimes prioritize rote memorization over meaningful, applicable learning.
>
> **Balancing the Two Perspectives**
>    - **The Hidden Value of "Useless" Knowledge**: Even if a subject seems irrelevant, it often contributes to a well-rounded education. For example, studying literature can improve empathy and communication skills, while science can foster curiosity and analytical thinking.
>    - **Adaptability**: The world is changing rapidly, and many jobs of the future don’t even exist yet. A broad education prepares students to adapt and learn new skills, even if the specifics of what they learned in school become outdated.
>    - **Customization**: Ideally, education systems should strike a balance between foundational knowledge and practical, personalized learning. This could mean offering more elective courses, project-based learning, or opportunities for students to explore real-world applications of what they’re studying.

Nod.

I like it.

* Foundation knowledge.
* Transferable skills.
* Broad perspective / "well rounded" and "connecting the dots backward".
* An on.

I then asked for arguments against this analogy and it was a little overwhelming. A little too close to home.

Best left in the chat.

You know how it is, confirmation bias and all...
