title: 'Terminator Bot'
---

I took a break from novella work to dip back into my [Quake bot archive](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/QuakeBotArchive) work.

I spend the morning digging into the release history for the Terminator client-side Quake bot by Olivier Montanuy and documenting it here:

* [Terminator Bot](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/QuakeBotArchive/blob/main/research/essays/b34_terminator.md)

It's so much fun.

I don't know how this work can be made valuable to others, but if I could justify doing a deep-dive into the research history for every bot in the archive, I would.

Resources that help in this type of work:

* [Quake Archive Search](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/QuakeArchiveSearch)
* [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)
* [Discmaster](https://discmaster.textfiles.com/)
* [Quake Addon CDs File Search](https://quakediscs.com/search/)
* [Google Groups Usenet Archive](https://groups.google.com/)

Great stuff!
