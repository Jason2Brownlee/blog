title: 'Raw Writing'
---

I was joking to my wife that people will get sick of AI writing and will push back with a reactive style.

Something like impressionistic and abstract art pushing back against polished realism.

We have seen this with music as well, the preference for analogue vinyl records over CDs. Or the preference for being disconnected like CD and tape walkmans over streaming.

Jokes often have a kernel of truth, I think some version of this will happen.

I joked that it would be a writing style that would be unambiguously human. Perhaps chaotic, error prone, etc.

Naturally, my LLM friends all agree.

> AI text tends to be highly coherent, grammatically flawless, and structurally predictable. Human writing, by contrast, often includes quirks, digressions, emotional rawness, or even deliberate fragmentation (like stream-of-consciousness or experimental prose). These could become markers of authenticity.

And:

> Think of autofiction, messy first-person narratives, or even glitch-like text (intentional typos, erratic punctuation) as a way to signal "human-made."

I think we can call it "feral writing" or "untamed writing" or "raw writing". Maybe "glitch lit"?

What's the opposite? For those that lean in? Silicon Prose?
