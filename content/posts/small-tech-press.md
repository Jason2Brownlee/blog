title: 'Small Tech Press'
---

Building on yesterdays idea of a [Quake Press](/blog/posts/quake-press/), a small tech press does sound fun.

I guess I did already, with [SuperFastPython](https://SuperFastPython) for Python concurrency.

But other niches might be fun to explore, especially a tiny niche where I could cover it completely and move on.

It's easier if it's motivated externally, e.g. using a tech at work, cover it at home, or a market starving for info on niche. Otherwise the "why" behind the whole enterprise has to be fabricated.

So why limited to tech?

Why not something else like CICO, an upcoming travel destination, something else off-line?

Nod. Fair.

Writers write. So write.
