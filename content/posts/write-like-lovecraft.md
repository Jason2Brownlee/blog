I was just re-reading "[Notes on Writing Weird Fiction](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/nwwf.aspx)" by H.P. Lovecraft.

In his essay, he gives three structured frameworks:

1. A 5-part procedure of writing weird stories.
2. The 4 types of stories you can write.
3. How to handle the 5 types of horror elements of a story.

I thought it might be interesting to extract them and clean them up a little.

I fed the essay into DeepSeek R1 and asked it to extract frameworks for modern writers, here's what I got:


## Lovecraft’s 5-Part Framework for Writing Weird Fiction

*A Step-by-Step Guide for Modern Authors*

### **1. Conceptualize the Core Horror**
**Task:** Define the "underlying horror" driving your story. This could be a supernatural entity, an uncanny phenomenon, or a cosmic truth that defies natural law.
- **Lovecraft’s Insight:**
  > *“The marvel must be treated very impressively and deliberately—with a careful emotional ‘build-up’—else it will seem flat and unconvincing.”*
  - Anchor your story in a single, central horror. Ensure it overshadows all other elements.
  - Example: A forbidden book that warps reality, an ancient god sleeping beneath a city.

### **2. Outline the Story’s Structure**
**Task:** Create two synopses:
- **Synopsis 1 (Chronological Order):**
  - List events in the order they *actually occur* (even if hidden from the reader).
  - Detail motivations, causes, and consequences.
  - Example: *“Describe with enough fulness to cover all vital points and motivate all incidents planned.”*

- **Synopsis 2 (Narrative Order):**
  - Reorganize events for dramatic impact (e.g., start with a mystery, use flashbacks).
  - Adjust pacing, perspective, and climax placement.
  - Example: Begin with a character discovering a cryptic artifact, then reveal its origins later.

**Key Flexibility:**
  > *“Never being bound by any previous design. If the development suddenly reveals new opportunities for dramatic effect… add whatever is thought advantageous.”*

### **3. Draft Rapidly with Atmospheric Focus**
**Task:** Write the first draft using Synopsis 2 as a guide. Prioritize mood over action.
- **Critical Guidelines:**
  - **Build Atmosphere:** Use sensory details (e.g., eerie sounds, oppressive weather) to evoke dread.
    > *“Atmosphere, not action, is the great desideratum of weird fiction.”*
  - **Maintain Realism:** Ground characters and settings in believable details—except when depicting the horror.
    > *“Inconceivable events… must be accomplished through the maintenance of careful realism in every phase of the story except that touching on the one given marvel.”*
  - **Emotional Intensity:** Characters should react to the horror with awe, terror, or existential dread.
    > *“Never have a wonder taken for granted… weave an air of awe.”*

### **4. Revise Ruthlessly**
**Task:** Refine the draft with attention to language, pacing, and coherence.
- **Checklist:**
  - **Trim Superfluities:** Remove redundant scenes, dialogue, or descriptions.
    > *“Remove all possible superfluities—words, sentences, paragraphs.”*
  - **Sharpen Transitions:** Ensure smooth shifts between slow, detailed scenes and fast-paced action.
  - **Climax Polish:** Amplify the horror’s impact through layered foreshadowing and symbolic imagery.
    > *“Prime emphasis should be given to subtle suggestion… shadings of moods and build up a vague illusion of the strange reality of the unreal.”*

### **5. Finalize with Precision**
**Task:** Prepare a clean manuscript, incorporating final tweaks.
- **Last Steps:**
  - Read aloud to test rhythm and tone.
  - Ensure all plot threads reconcile with the central horror.
  - Example: *“Add final revisory touches where they seem in order.”*

### **Lovecraft’s Golden Rules**
1. **Horror First:** Let the uncanny element dominate the narrative.
2. **Mood Over Plot:** Atmosphere and suggestion trump action sequences.
3. **Character Reactions:** Even jaded protagonists should feel the weight of the unknown.
   > *“The characters should shew the same overwhelming emotion… in real life.”*




## Lovecraft’s 4 Types of Weird Fiction Stories

### **1. Mood-Driven Stories**
**Core Focus:** Evoke a pervasive emotion or atmosphere (e.g., dread, cosmic awe, existential horror).

**Key Elements:**
- Prioritize setting and sensory details over plot mechanics.
- Use symbolism and suggestive language to immerse readers in the mood.
- Example: A decaying mansion that embodies despair, or a fog-shrouded town radiating unease.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Identify the Mood:** Decide the emotional core (e.g., "inexplicable terror").
2. **Build the Environment:** Craft a setting that embodies the mood through vivid descriptions.
3. **Minimize Action:** Let the atmosphere drive tension rather than overt events.
   > *“Atmosphere, not action, is the great desideratum of weird fiction.”*

### **2. Pictorial Conception Stories**
**Core Focus:** A striking visual image or tableau (e.g., a monstrous entity, an alien landscape).

**Key Elements:**
- Begin with a vivid mental image, then construct a narrative around it.
- Use the image as the story’s anchor, explaining its origin or impact.
- Example: A cyclopean city of non-Euclidean geometry, or a living statue that haunts its creators.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Visualize the Image:** Define the central visual (e.g., “a writhing mass of eyes in the dark”).
2. **Contextualize the Marvel:** Explain how the image disrupts reality (e.g., ancient curse, alien artifact).
3. **Reveal Gradually:** Unfold the image’s significance through character reactions and lore.
   > *“The marvel must… overshadow the characters and events.”*

### **3. Conceptual/Legendary Stories**
**Core Focus:** Explore a premise rooted in myth, intellectual idea, or hypothetical condition.

**Key Elements:**
- Base the story on a legend, scientific anomaly, or philosophical dilemma.
- Focus on implications rather than individual characters.
- Example: A town bound by a pact with eldritch gods, or a law of physics that unravels sanity.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Define the Concept:** Choose a foundational idea (e.g., “time is a sentient force”).
2. **Worldbuild Logically:** Create rules for how the concept warps reality.
3. **Show Consequences:** Depict how characters and settings are transformed by the concept.
   > *“Conflict with time seems to me the most potent… theme in all human expression.”*

### **4. Climax-Centric Stories**
**Core Focus:** Build toward a singular, devastating revelation or event.

**Key Elements:**
- Structure the narrative to amplify the climax’s impact.
- Use foreshadowing and pacing to heighten suspense.
- Example: Archaeologists uncovering a forbidden truth, or a ritual’s catastrophic outcome.

**Development Steps:**
1. **Identify the Climax:** Decide the pivotal moment (e.g., “the protagonist becomes the monster”).
2. **Reverse-Engineer the Plot:** Plant clues and symbols that lead inexorably to the climax.
3. **Maximize Emotional Payoff:** Ensure the climax resonates with existential weight.
   > *“Prime emphasis should be given to subtle suggestion… to build up a vague illusion of the strange reality of the unreal.”*

### **Universal Principles for All Types**
- **Maintain Realism:** Ground everything except the central marvel in plausibility.
- **Character Reactions:** Even jaded figures should reflect awe or terror.
  > *“Never have a wonder taken for granted… weave an air of awe.”*
- **Revise for Atmosphere:** Trim excess plot to preserve mood and symbolic depth.




## Lovecraft's 5 Types of Horror Elements

### **1. The Underlying Horror (Core Abnormality)**
**Definition:** The foundational source of fear—an entity, condition, or cosmic truth that violates natural law.

**How to Use It:**
- Define a central horror that is inherently *unknowable* or *inexplicable* (e.g., an ancient god, a cursed lineage, a reality-warping force).
- Ensure it transcends mundane understanding to evoke existential dread.
  > *“The marvel must… overshadow the characters and events.”*

**Task:**
- Write a one-sentence “horror premise” (e.g., *“A forbidden tome awakens a dormant entity that devours time.”*).

### **2. General Effects (Broad Consequences)**
**Definition:** The horror’s impact on the world or characters—societal decay, environmental blight, psychological erosion.

**How to Use It:**
- Show how the horror disrupts normality (e.g., crops failing, madness spreading, laws of physics fracturing).
- Avoid isolated scares; let the horror’s influence permeate everything.

**Task:**
- List 3-5 systemic consequences of your horror (e.g., *“Time loops trap villagers,” “Memories dissolve,” “Architecture shifts unnaturally.”*).

### **3. Mode of Manifestation (Visible Phenomena)**
**Definition:** How the horror physically/materially appears or interacts with the world.

**How to Use It:**
- Design tangible, sensory manifestations (e.g., grotesque mutations, cryptic symbols, unnatural sounds).
- Ground the horror in specific, eerie details to make it feel *real*.
  > *“Use subtle suggestion… to build up a vague illusion of the strange reality of the unreal.”*

**Task:**
- Describe 2-3 visceral phenomena tied to your horror (e.g., *“A black sludge oozes from walls,” “Voices whisper in dead languages,” “Shadows move against the light.”*).

### **4. Fear Reactions (Character Responses)**
**Definition:** How characters emotionally and psychologically respond to the horror.

**How to Use It:**
- Show escalating reactions: curiosity → denial → terror → existential despair.
- Even seasoned characters should grapple with awe or paralysis.
  > *“Never have a wonder taken for granted… weave an air of awe.”*

**Task:**
- Draft a scene where a character encounters the horror, focusing on their visceral reaction (e.g., trembling, obsessive fixation, fragmented speech).

### **5. Specific Effects (Tailored Consequences)**
**Definition:** The horror’s unique impact on the story’s particular setting, characters, or plot.

**How to Use It:**
- Tie the horror’s effects to the story’s context (e.g., a family curse corrupting bloodlines, a scientist’s experiment warping their town).
- Ensure the horror’s “rules” align with the narrative’s internal logic.

**Task:**
- Define one irreversible consequence of the horror (e.g., *“The protagonist’s body slowly crystallizes,” “The town vanishes from maps and memory.”*).

### **Synthesis Example**
**Premise:** *A lighthouse keeper discovers an alien organism in the ocean.*
1. **Underlying Horror:** A parasitic cosmic entity that assimilates living matter.
2. **General Effects:** Marine life mutates, tides stop, townsfolk vanish.
3. **Manifestation:** Bioluminescent tendrils in the water, distorted animal cries.
4. **Fear Reactions:** The keeper oscillates between fascination and terror, documenting changes until his notes devolve into frantic scribbles.
5. **Specific Effects:** The keeper’s skin grows translucent, revealing the entity beneath.

**Lovecraft’s Key Insight:**
> *“Inconceivable events… must be accomplished through the maintenance of careful realism in every phase of the story except that touching on the one given marvel.”*

Use this framework to ensure your horror feels both *inescapable* and *inexplicable*—a shadow that lingers long after the story ends.
