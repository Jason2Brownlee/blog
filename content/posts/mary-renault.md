title: 'Mary Renault Books on Ancient Greece'
---

I've been casting around for good books for my eldest to read about Greece.

I came across a series of historical fiction books by [Mary Renault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Renault) that are well regarded.

There are one-offs like:

* [The Last of the Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Wine)

Two book series, such as this one about [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus):

* [The King Must Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_Must_Die)
* [The Bull from the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bull_from_the_Sea)

And three book series, such as this one about Alexander the Great:

* [Fire from Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_from_Heaven)
* [The Persian Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persian_Boy)
* [Funeral Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_Games_(novel))

There's a complete list here:

* [Novels about Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Renault#Novels_about_Ancient_Greece)

I'll read some (starting with the books on Theseus) and pass them on if they are a good fit.
