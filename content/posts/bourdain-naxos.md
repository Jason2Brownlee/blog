title: 'Anthony Bourdain on Naxos'
---

I've been sniffing around for more material on [Naxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxos), an island in the [Cyclades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclades) I'm plan on visiting.

I came across an episode of the TV show "[Parts Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain:_Parts_Unknown)" by [Anthony Bourdain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain) focused on the island circa 2015.

There's a few copies on youtube here and there, e.g.:

* [Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown | The Greek Islands | S07 E03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvWOt4qaAwk)

Very nice.

It looks like he visited out of season because he and others are in jeans most of the time.

Looks beautiful. The food too!
