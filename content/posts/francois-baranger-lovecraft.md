title: "François Baranger's Lovecraft"

Related to [yesterday's post on Lovecraft manga](/blog/posts/gou-tanabe-manga/), I also recently read illustrated Lovecraft stories by [François Baranger](https://francois-baranger.com/).

Specifically his two volume:

* [At the Mountains of Madness vol1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55510335-at-the-mountains-of-madness-vol-1)
* [At the Mountains of Madness vol2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58760587-at-the-mountains-of-madness-vol-2)

The story is good, of course (one of my faves), but the illustrations are beyond words.

Sublime.

Look at examples on google image search!

I want to order his illustrated: "[Call of Cthulhu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36523094-l-appel-de-cthulhu)", but it's so expensive. These are not cheap books.

Nevertheless, they are sooo good!
