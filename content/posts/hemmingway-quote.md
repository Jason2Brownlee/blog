I read "[Ernest Hemingway on Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19761213-ernest-hemingway-on-writing)" yesterday.

Great stuff!

The final passage got me, and made me chuckle.

Here's a snippet:


> You must be prepared to work always without applause.
> [...]
> Finally, in some other place, some other time, when you can’t work and feel like hell you will pick up the book and look in it and start to read and go on and in a little while say to your wife, "Why this stuff is bloody marvelous."
>
> “And she will say, "Darling, I always told you it was." Or maybe she doesn’t hear you and says, "What did you say?" and you do not repeat the remark.

It's the "_What did you say?_".

Hehe. Exactly. No one cares, not even your all caring wife, and that's okay :)
