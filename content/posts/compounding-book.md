title: 'Compounding Book'

I finished [Sahil Bloom](https://x.com/SahilBloom)'s "[The 5 Types of Wealth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212806718-the-5-types-of-wealth)" the other day.

Toward the end, there was a chapter/section on compounding.

It gave the [grains of rice chessboard parable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem), and the usual benefits for understanding it and harnessing it.

Good stuff.

It got me thinking:

> We (humans) are terrible at understanding exponentials, like compounding.

And:

> I'd LOVE a tiny book on the magic of compounding.

I was thinking a whole lot of stuff to help hammer home the point.

A book one could pick up and re-read again and again as a reminder, with:

- diagrams
- parables
- quotes
- stories
- examples

And on.

I'm sure there are books out there, perhaps focused on kids or investors. Any general audience books?

At the very least, collecting the examples and sharing on a static site would be fun!
