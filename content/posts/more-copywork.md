I'm still thinking about [copywork](/blog/posts/copywork-quotes/).

The previous experiment ([Lovecraft Copywork](/blog/posts/lovecraft-copywork/)) was no good.

In fact, it sucks, and not just because the UI is rough.

[Using it now](https://jasonbrownlee.me/LovecraftCopywork/) feels more like a typing exercise, not like copywork.

For this case to work, I think a better approach would to to create beautiful letter/a4-sized pages of text with large font that can be printed and used as a reference for the writer to _**hand-copy**_, away from the workstation.

This is key. **Hand-copy**. Slow things down.

A book of these examples would be great. But what's the difference between this and using a paperback of Lovecraft stories?

* Goal (copy vs read)
* Form factor (large vs small)
* Line spacing (large vs small)
* Font size (large vs small)

What else?

* Curated for the most interesting (public domain) stories.
* Stories from related authors (e.g. yellow king)
* We could trim a story to one or two key/fun/interesting/etc scenes.
* We could have a large margin to allow notes
* We could have blank page opposite each scene to allow copywork directly into the book
* Spiral bound so it sits flat.
* Number lines, and actual lines under the text.
* Progress indicators (percent) through large stories
* Divide the book by themes, and then stories/scenes
* Vocab notes before/after/footnotes/margin notes/etc.
* Color coding literary devices (if possible)
* Word counts by story/page/etc.
* Bookmark ribbon for keeping track where you're up to
* etc.

Very cool. Some of this is do-able with print on demand, other stuff would require a specialty book printer.

Also, I'm pretty sure there's a [bug in the JS](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/LovecraftCopywork), as the prose does not make sense from one block to the next. Oh well.

I was thinking back to [copywork for programmers](/blog/posts/code-that/).

We could do the same thing, in terms of the design of the book.

Large font, large form factor, one algorithm per page, etc.

Copywork requires _work_, and transcribing from print back to the terminal is a heavy-enough lift I think.

The MVP is a static site, then perhaps progress to beautiful PDFs, then a book.

If I can't let go of this, I may need to do a pilot with a class of algorithms/data structures/etc.
