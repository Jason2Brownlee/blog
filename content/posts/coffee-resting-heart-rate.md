title: 'Coffee and Resting Heart Rate'
---

I drink 3-4 coffees a day, sometimes tea (earl grey) as well.

I was thinking, is this elevating my resting heart rate? Am m I going to die earlier because of my coffee habit?

I don't think so.

I checked in with o3.

> The short answer: At the level you describe — about 3–4 single espressos a day (≈ 180-320 mg caffeine) — there is no solid evidence that your resting heart rate will stay chronically elevated or that you will damage your heart over time, provided you are otherwise healthy, keep your blood pressure in the normal range and sleep well.

And:

> Bottom line: In regular coffee drinkers who stay under ~400 mg/day, completely dropping caffeine is unlikely to lower resting HR by more than 1–3 bpm—well within day-to-day biological variation.

I recall coffee is correlated with longer life/better heart health.

Yep:

> Across dozens of prospective cohorts—including the UK Biobank—and several recent dose-response meta-analyses, habitual coffee drinking is correlated with a modestly lower risk of dying from any cause and from most major cardiovascular diseases. The relationship is non-linear (a “J-” or “U-shaped” curve): the greatest advantage is seen at roughly 2 – 4 cups a day (≈ 150 – 400 mg caffeine), after which the benefit plateaus and may drift back toward neutral at very high intakes.

Stick to 1-3 cups.

Why? Lots of guesses in the response. My guess is that if you're the kind of person that drinks a lot of coffee you are contentious, not eating badly and drinking alcohol. Meaning, it's not causal, but a marker of the kind of person that drinks lots of coffee is healthy.

o3 and 4o generally agree, but they are sycophantic by default.

Relax. Smell the coffee.
