I've been writing novellas for my kids for the last few months.

The writing is fine. The stories, fine. Not mind blowing.

The real trick is personalization.

Telling stories about the kids as characters in places they know with our inside jokes.

They are personalized stories. Written for them.

This is key. It makes up for the so-so stories and writing.

It's a lot of work. It's a heavy collaboration, a lot of careful specification by me of specific details to include.

We'll get more of this (e.g. media personalization "as a service") as the models get better.

Movies, video games, news, etc.

If we can load in our personal history as context, we could get a retelling of a classical story that is personalized. Or a re-telling of a new best seller that is personalized.

Places we are/know.

We could become the main character. Our friends as side kicks or background characters. Villains.

Loading in the personal history is challenging. Easier if we all have an always-on pendant recording all the things. Harder for us old timers with no such recording, just poor recollections stored in meat.

Fun fun.
