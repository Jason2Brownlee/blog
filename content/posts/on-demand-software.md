I just saw [this tweet](https://x.com/amasad/status/1886859253648122181) go by [Amjad Masad](https://x.com/amasad), [Replit](https://replit.com/)'s CEO:

It's a video promoting "coding on the phone".

Watch it.

Personal, bespoke, on-demand, disposable, etc. software.

I love this! I love the direction we're going!

Some names for this, after chatting with my bro gpt4o:

* **On-Demand Software Development**: Like cloud computing, but for instant, local, personal software.
* **Ephemeral Coding**: Like Snapchat for code—software you generate when you need it, and discard when done.
* **LLM-First Programming**: The same way we talk about "Mobile-First" or "Cloud-First" design.
* **Personal Computation**: Instead of general-purpose software for others, this is about computing tailored to you.
* **Generative Programming**: Like generative art, but for software. The goal isn’t writing code—it’s guiding code into existence.

I want the "thing", not the hours of coding to get the thing. Especially with modern web-programming stacks that I don't grok at all. Give me [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) :)

I still love programming.

This, above, is very different from the deep-down-in-my-bones love of sitting down at my terminal with an open textbook, an algorithm description, and my C compiler. (maybe a paper pdf, sublime text, and python/numpy these days...)

Delete 90% of the cowboy hackers calling themselves "programmers".

Free the 90% of the CS class that don't actually like locking themselves away to code all night long.

On-demand software "_for the rest of us_".

It's directional, we're done done yet.

No CRM on demand yet, but soonish.
