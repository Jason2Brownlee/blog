title: 'Minimize Lifetime Insulin'
---

I was reading and re/reading [Mark Sisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sisson) books this week.

For example:

* [The Primal Blueprint](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6515468-the-primal-blueprint)
* [Primal Endurance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26783235-primal-endurance)

Good ideas. Eat whole foods. Low carb. Lift heavy with few reps, etc.

Anyway, one thing he mentioned a few times across the books was to:

> Minimize lifetime insulin secretion

Now, this does not mean become a type 1 diabetic.

It means something like, the mammals/people that minimize insulin secretion across their life live longer/heather.

It's just another way of saying to cut the crappy carbs for life, do intermittent fasting, probably high-fat, e.g. keto, all with a lean towards suggesting a mechanism for the benefit: low insulin.

Maybe it's true (e.g. [Carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet#Carbohydrate-insulin_hypothesis)). Maybe it's not. But it might be a helpful guiding idea.

Thoughts from gpt5:

> ...The concept that “minimizing lifetime insulin exposure” contributes to longevity has strong theoretical and animal‐model support, and there are good reasons to suspect it has relevance in humans. But it is not yet a proven prescription in humans that you should aim to minimize your insulin as much as possible to extend lifespan.
