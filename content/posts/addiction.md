I just read two books on celebrities whose lives were ruined by addiction:

* [Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59641216-friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing), Matthew Perry.
* [The Book of Sheen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234383003-the-book-of-sheen), Charlie Sheen.

I'm so glad this disease does not afflict my wife or myself, and I **really hope** my sons are spared.

It also reminds me of a Charlie Munger quote along the lines of

> "_the hard thing about being rich/famous/powerful is not losing your mind_"

I think this is the actual quote I was thinking of:

> "_You need an ability to not be driven crazy by extreme success._"

-- [Charlie Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man â€” here are 18 of his most brilliant quotes](https://www.businessinsider.com/charlie-munger-quotes-2019-5)

Right on.
