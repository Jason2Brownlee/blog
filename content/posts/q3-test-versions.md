title: 'Q3Test Versions'
---

I was thinking a lot about the [q3test bots](/blog/posts/q3test-bots/) written about yesterday.

Nostalgia.

What test versions were released when?

## IHV Leak

The IHV leaked perhaps late February or early March 1999.

* [Quake III Arena IHV Test Leaked](https://www.bluesnews.com/s/386/quake-iii-arena-ihv-test-leaked), Mar 01, 1999

## Q3Test Mac (v1.01?)

In late April a Mac version of the Q3Test was released:

Including:

* `MacQ3Test.bin`

## Q3Test v1.03

An updated Mac version was released along with a linux version and a win32 server:

An update to v1.05 including the first win32 version:

## Q3Test v1.07

An update to v1.07:

* [Win32 Q3Test 1.07 Released](https://www.bluesnews.com/s/3810/win32-q3test-1-07-released), Jul 20, 1999

* `q3test_107.exe`
* `q3test-linux-1.07-glibc-4.i386.tar.gz`
* `q3test-linux-1.07-glibc-4.i386.rpm`

## Q3Test v1.08

Update to v1.08:

* [Win32 & Mac Q3Test 1.08 Released](https://www.bluesnews.com/s/4220/win32-mac-q3test-1-08-released), Aug 03, 1999.

Including:

* `q3test_108.exe`
* `q3test_win32_1_08.exe`
* `MacQ3Test_1_08.bin`

## Q3Test v1.09 (Q3DemoTest)

And finally a Q3Test Demo:

* [Local Quake III Arena Test Demo](https://www.bluesnews.com/s/7557/local-quake-iii-arena-test-demo), Nov 15, 1999

Including:

* `q3DemoTEST.exe`
* `q3DemoTEST.bin`

Full demo:

* `Q3ADemo.exe`
* `q3demoTEST-1.10-5.i386.tar.gz`
* `q3demoTEST-1.10-5.i386.rpm`

## Q3Test Timeline

So the Q3Test timeline is something like:

* Mar 01, 1999, IHV leak
* Apr 24, 1999, Mac (v1.01?)
* ??? ??, 1999, v1.02
* Apr 29, 1999, v1.03
* ??? ??, 1999, v1.04
* May 10, 1999, v1.05 (first win32 client?)
* Jul 16, 1999, v1.06
* Jul 20, 1999, v1.07
* Aug 03, 1999, v1.08
* Nov 15, 1999, v1.09 (demo)

If the [bot hack](/blog/posts/q3test-bots/) was released late May 1999, then it makes sense it was for v1.05 on win32.
