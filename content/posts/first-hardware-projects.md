title: 'First Hardware Projects'
---

I've been working on trying to acquire hardware for the "[Old Desktop PCs for Learning](/blog/posts/old-desktop-pc/)" project for my eldest.

We have a few bits and are hoping to get a few more. It's harder than I thought. I guess the e-waste initiatives are working. In the old days, there were tons of old hardware out there in hard rubbish and in peoples garages.

Anyway, once we get a good base stock of hardware we need workshop projects to work through.

Short sessions, to keep interest and get a result.

Some ideas:

1. What is a computer (e.g. hardware, software, operating system, bios, etc.)
2. Does it boot?
3. Rules about hardware/desktops (e.g. static charge, don't move while running, airflow, etc.)
4. Open it up and identify everything (drives, motherboard, cpu ram, etc.)
5. Disassemble, then reassemble (just ram/cpu, everything)
6. System card (size/type/brand of everything in the box)

What else?

- Install a video card
- Install a network card and get it on the internet
- Boot from cd/dvd/usb
- Introduction to the bios


I pasted this and chatted with gpt4o and we worked out a program with progression and clear per-task objectives:



## üõ†Ô∏è **Computer Hardware Workshop Series (Parent & Child Edition)**

### **Session 1: What *Is* a Computer?**

* **Concept**: Understand what makes a computer a computer.
* **Learn**: Hardware vs. software; operating systems; BIOS/UEFI; input/output devices.
* **Outcome**: Can describe how a computer works in plain language.


### **Session 2: Does It Boot?**

* **Concept**: Learn about the boot process and basic diagnostics.
* **Learn**: Power-on, BIOS screen, error beeps, signs of life (fans, lights).
* **Outcome**: Can power on a PC and determine whether it boots or not‚Äîand why.


### **Session 3: Rules for Working with Desktops**

* **Concept**: Safety and care for working with desktop PCs.
* **Learn**: Electrostatic discharge (ESD), airflow, cleaning, never move while running.
* **Outcome**: Can safely handle and maintain a desktop.


### **Session 4: Open the Box ‚Äì What‚Äôs Inside?**

* **Concept**: Identify and understand all major components.
* **Learn**: Motherboard, CPU, RAM, PSU, drives, GPU, network card, cables.
* **Outcome**: Can name each part and explain its function.


### **Session 5: Hands-On Disassembly & Reassembly**

* **Concept**: Learn how to remove and re-seat key components.
* **Learn**: Proper removal/insertion of RAM, CPU, heatsink, drives, expansion cards.
* **Outcome**: Can confidently take apart and reassemble a working PC.


### **Session 6: Make a System Card**

* **Concept**: Document what‚Äôs in a computer.
* **Learn**: Find make/model of CPU, RAM, motherboard, PSU, GPU, etc.
* **Outcome**: Has a completed spec sheet for a real machine.


### **Session 7: Exploring the BIOS/UEFI**

* **Concept**: Introduction to the computer's low-level firmware.
* **Learn**: How to enter BIOS, change boot order, check temps and fan speeds.
* **Outcome**: Can navigate BIOS and make non-destructive changes.


### **Session 8: Installing Expansion Cards**

* **Concept**: Learn how to add new functionality.
* **Learn**: Install a video card and a network card.
* **Outcome**: Successfully upgrade a PC with new hardware.


### **Session 9: Connecting to the Internet**

* **Concept**: Networking basics.
* **Learn**: Use Ethernet or Wi-Fi cards; troubleshoot connectivity.
* **Outcome**: Can get a machine online via hardware and OS tools.


### **Session 10: Booting from External Media**

* **Concept**: Understanding alternative boot methods.
* **Learn**: Boot from CD/DVD or USB; create a bootable Linux USB.
* **Outcome**: Can boot into a live Linux distro and explore it safely.


### **Optional Add-On Sessions**

* **Install an Operating System**

  * Wipe drive, partition, install Windows or Linux.
  * Outcome: Fully working clean install.

* **Computer Repair Challenge**

  * Diagnose and fix a non-booting or slow PC.
  * Outcome: Applies troubleshooting knowledge to solve real issues.

* **Build a Complete PC from Parts**

  * Use everything learned to build a functioning system from scratch.
  * Outcome: Built and booted a fully working desktop.
