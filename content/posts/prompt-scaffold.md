title: 'Prompt Scaffold'
---

I have been thinking of coding up some more elaborate prompt scaffolding for writing projects.

Today, I watched:

* [I Got AI to Write a Book with One Click, and It Was...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We_QOxNs0bw&ab_channel=TheNerdyNovelist)

It's a great video.

It uses [Make](https://www.make.com/) connected to models via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

It's you're classic code-free workflow tool, but for prompting LLMs.

It starts with a sequence for developing the story outline, then uses the outline to create 3 outlines of chapters in parallel.

Here's a screenshot of the overview:

Here's a screenshot of the workflow for the book outline:

Here's a screenshot of the workflow for the chapters for act1:

I like this.

I can see areas for improvements, e.g. it clearly needs loops and prior chapter as context for next chapter. But I can also see stuff I would not have thought of, e.g. repeated iterations of critique and improve, especially on the outline where it would have the biggest effect.

It would save me time as I have been doing things like this manually with a suite of front-line models, although with a lot more hand tweaking at each step to push things in the directions I want.

I must experiment with this.
