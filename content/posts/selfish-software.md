title: 'Selfish Software'

I just read a new post by Edmar Ferreira titled:

* [Selfish Software](https://every.to/source-code/selfish-software)

It's his take on what we previously called "[chat-driven programming](/blog/posts/chat-driven-programming)", but perhaps broader.

I thought it was user-focused, but his description too is engineer focused, but more personal. His journey.

> Selfish software refers to writing code for yourself without any external customers in mind.

I like the name, I guess.

I like the "how to start section" too.

For example, this snippet on the need to re-think the approach:

> It can be challenging to jump into selfish software after being accustomed to searching for customers and making projects for profit. I had to rewrite my own workflows and to rethink how I approached work.

The main steps:

* Tune out external noise (e.g. play, get creative, have fun, rather than market-focus)
* Identify personal pain points (e.g. track small user pains all the time)
* Start with small pieces of “disposable software" (e.g. one-off scripts)
* Develop personal software for ongoing use (e.g. larger projects once you have confidence + processes)
* Maintain a playful mindset (e.g. what would make this cooler, do that)
* Scale or don’t scale—it’s your choice (e.g. scale or stay small/personal, and that's okay)

Nod.

So far, most of the code I have generated feels like "_disposable software_", even the stuff I've put on webpages and github.

The reason is because I know I can generate it again fast, and probably better.

I strongly believe software (interfaces) are going to be generated on demand.

For example:

Why talk to an LLM when it can generate a custom interface to _show you_ the answer to a question and allow you to play with it.

Agree with the final point, it's about re-discovering the joy in making/creating.

> Selfish software is not about ignoring user needs altogether; it’s about restoring the joy of building by making yourself the user you’re most eager to please.

A nice swing-back from indie-hacking software for the market that was so popular for a decade+.

> Building for yourself has never been more accessible—or more fun.

Agreed!

Good piece.

Also see some of Edmar's substack pieces where he tested some of these ideas:
