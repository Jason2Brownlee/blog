I love the movie [Gattaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca).

I've probably watched it a dozen times since I first saw it in the late 1990s. Especially when dvd's were a thing. These days, it's very hard to find if and where an old classic is available.

Anyway, here's a synopsis of the movie via our friend gpt4o:

> *Gattaca* (1997) is a sci-fi thriller set in a dystopian future where genetic engineering determines a person’s social status and opportunities. The story follows **Vincent Freeman**, a naturally conceived "in-valid" with genetic imperfections that limit his aspirations. He dreams of traveling to space but is denied entry into the prestigious Gattaca Aerospace Corporation due to his inferior genetics.
>
> To achieve his dream, Vincent assumes the identity of **Jerome Eugene Morrow**, a genetically superior but paralyzed former athlete. Using Jerome’s DNA samples (blood, urine, hair), Vincent deceives the system and secures a spot as a navigator for an upcoming space mission.
>
> As the launch date nears, a murder within Gattaca triggers an investigation that threatens to expose Vincent’s deception. Meanwhile, he falls in love with **Irene Cassini**, a fellow Gattaca employee with her own genetic flaws.
>
> Despite close calls and growing suspicion from authorities—including Vincent’s genetically superior brother, **Anton**, who is leading the investigation—Vincent manages to outmaneuver them. In a final confrontation, Vincent defeats Anton in a swimming contest, proving that determination can surpass genetic destiny.
>
> In the end, Jerome, who feels his life is meaningless without perfection, gives Vincent his final DNA samples and ends his own life. Vincent boards the spaceship, fulfilling his dream and challenging society’s rigid genetic discrimination.
>
> The film explores themes of **genetic determinism, identity, free will, and human potential.**

I think it is broadly regarded as a [good film](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gattaca), few people in tech and academia have not heard of it.

I love the soundtrack, and listen to it all the time.

The track "_The other side_" really gets me, it captures Vincent's story. The scene in the movie where Vincent out-swims his brother Anton, and Anton asks "_how are you doing this?_". Vincent responds "_i never saved anything for the swim back_".

My god that's good. He never held or holds anything back. Writer+director [Andrew Niccol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Niccol) is a master.

From our gpt4o friend on this scene:

> When Anton, exhausted and struggling to stay afloat, asks **"How are you doing this?"**, Vincent responds:
**"I never saved anything for the swim back."**
>
> This line is deeply symbolic. It means that Vincent **never held back, never played it safe, and never planned for failure**. He put everything he had into moving forward, refusing to accept limitations imposed by society or even his own body. Unlike Anton, who had the privilege of superior genetics and relied on it, Vincent had to rely on sheer willpower, proving that effort and perseverance matter more than predetermined ability.
>
> This moment also mirrors Vincent’s entire life philosophy. While Anton always had a safety net (his genetic superiority), Vincent had to fight for every opportunity. The swim represents not just their childhood rivalry, but also Vincent’s lifelong struggle to prove that he is more than his DNA.
>
> By winning the swim, Vincent symbolically **defies his supposed genetic inferiority**, showing that the human spirit and determination can surpass even the most scientifically advanced predictions.

I love this theme from the movie. Not genetic determinism, that's fine. It's something else.

When I think of the story, I think of overcoming ~~the impossible~~ hard problems with human will. Or something.

It's drive, grit, perseverance, tenacity, ambition, gutting it out, going anyway and going hard. Giving everything.

This matches the tagline on the movie poster:

> There is not gene for the human spirit

Exactly. That human potential cannot be reduced to genetics alone. To a single number or score. To a single event or test. We are more, or we can be more.

Maybe it hits home for me (and so many others) because we can strive and work our way up. Because we are all inferior and imposters gutting it out, working our way up and through - on some level.

Not sure what me think about Gattaca this morning, but I'm glad I did :)
