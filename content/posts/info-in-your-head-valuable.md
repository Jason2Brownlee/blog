title: 'Information In Your Head Is Valuable'
---

I was talking to someone the other day about how to earn some extra cash.

I said something like:

> There is information in your head that is valuable to other people, so valuable that they would happily pay you to learn it. Even over zoom. All you have to do is figure out what information and what people.

It's true, but challenging advice.

It's the "_All you have to do is figure out what information and what people_" piece that is so hard.

The **what** and the **who**.

- Once you know the what, you can design an offer/product.
- Once you know the who, you can design marketing/sales/advertising/distribution.

I think the "who" follows from the "what".

Once you find the "what", you can target different "who's" that need that knowledge for some strong reason.

The "what" then, is where to focus. And it will be something you have a lot of experience in, or something you have achieved or done that others want to do.

To dial it in, my advice would be to try lots of stuff. Browse lots of forums and chat groups on things you know about and offer free advice. Help for free. See what resonates both with people you help (it does help) and with yourself (you like helping). It might take a few weeks. Try lots of different things, don't commit too early. Continue until you stop learning new things about what/who.

This is powerful true advice. And I think it will always be true.

I think all of this comes from a decade plus of digging into [authority sites](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/AuthoritySite).
