title: 'Q3Test Bots'
---

Before Quake3 was released there were public test versions. And before that there was a leaked IHV version.

I acquired and played all of them.

I remember spending a lot of time trying to get bots working with one of these releases.

It may have been the q3test v1.05.

We had to run a program that modified the game, then we could use commands in-game to spawn bots. The fun was figuring out what all the bot commands did.

The bots were no good, but we had a lot of fun with it all.

I remember chatting in the [shuga shack forums](https://web.archive.org/web/19991001204309/http://www.shugashack.com/msgboard/quake1.htm) about all of this at the time. The specific threads may not have been archived sadly.

Let's dig in.

I [found](https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/23382/Chip_1999-12_cd.bin/servis/tipy/web/soubory/q3tbots.zip) `q3tbots.zip` that contains `q3tbots.txt` and `q3tbots.exe`:

```text
-rw-rw-r--  0 0      0        2564 31 May  1999 q3tbots.txt
-rw-rw-r--  0 0      0       32768 31 May  1999 q3tbots.exe
```

Here's the header of the readme:

```text

================================================================
Title                   : Q3Test Bots Galore
Filename                : q3tbots.exe

Email Address           : yogre@hotmail.com
Description             : Enables Bots in Quake 3 Test
================================================================

...
```

That's right...

YoGrE figured it out and we were all chatting on the shuga shack message board.

It says it was for the Q3Test and is dated May 31 1999.

I suspect that this was the Q3Test v1.05.

It seems that this patch was replaced by an easier method:

```text
Thanks to YoGrE, we don't need this exe patching thing anymore.
Just rename your demoq3 folder to baseq3 and put this named
productid.txt <http://quake.at.frob.org/files/misc/productid.txt>
into baseq3 .
```

I also found this:

```text
Bots are back!

Bots dont work on 106/7/8

so you need to get 105 from the Q3TESTfiles page first

Then get the q3bots 1.1 here..

q3bots1.1
```

It suggests an updated version of `q3tbots.zip` as `q3tbots-1.1.zip` or `q3tbots-1_1.zip`.

It also confirms that bots only worked with Q3Test v1.05.

A copy of the v1.1 readme was posted on Usenet:

Interestingly, an alternate version (ripped off?) was shared here:

Here's the readme header:

Finally, I created a Geocities site to document all my findings and shared the link on Usenet:

What do you think?, 4 Nov 1999

Check out my webpage, what do you think?
Do I need to change/add/remove anything?
BTW there is a lot of info on q3bots!
