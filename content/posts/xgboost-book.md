[XGBoost is all you need](https://xgboosting.com/xgboost-is-all-you-need/) (for predictive modelling with tabular data), or so they say.

I have used XGBoost for a long time, since shortly after it was developed.

I wrote one of the first books about it in 2018.

Last year, I created a website with 500+ recipes showing how to use XGBoost:

* [XGBoosting.com](https://XGBoosting.com)

And the twitter feed:

* [@XGBoostAwesome](https://x.com/XGBoostAwesome)

The site is doing well, getting many thousands of visitors each week.

I was thinking of collecting all of the best/most helpful recipes together into a simple recipe book.

Maybe offer it cheaply on kindle and paperback.

I had the idea of polling visitors to the site, but I think I'll just do it regardless, if I decide to go ahead.

Writing down this idea is supposed to exorcise it, but I fear it's doing the opposite (possessing me?).
