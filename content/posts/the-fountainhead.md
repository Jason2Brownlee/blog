title: 'A Scene From "The Fountainhead"'
---

I've probably read Ayn Rand's [The Fountainhead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122.The_Fountainhead) about a dozen times over the years.

I'm not really into the philosophy of Objectivism, but I'm a fan of the individualism.

Really, I'm a sucker for simple hero stories (think Ender's Game, Dune, etc.)

Not sure I'll read the book again for a while. It's comforting to re-read, but I've had enough for now.

Anyway, there's a scene that I think back on often.

The protagonist (Howard Roark) and antagonist (Ellsworth Toohey) meet. Generally, the antagonist works hard to tear down the protagonist and people like him (individualists).

In the scene, he asks:

> "Mr. Roark, we're alone here. Why don't you tell me what you think of me? In any words you wish. No one will hear us."

The protagonist responds:

> "But I don't think of you."

SNAP!

"**_I don't even think of you._**"

True or not (it's true for our hero), it's so good.

The strength of that.

I recall it was taken from a real line delivered by Rand's husband.

(searching...)

Yes, from the introduction to the 25th anniversary edition:

> ... For instance, one of the most effective lines in The Fountainhead comes at the end of Part II, when, in reply to Toohey's question: "Why don't you tell me what you think of me?" Roark answers: "But I don't think of you." That line was Frank's answer to a different type of person, in a somewhat similar context.

Wow.

Another scene comes to mind when I think of this.

In this case, a scene from [Good Will Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Will_Hunting).

From [the script](https://assets.scriptslug.com/live/pdf/scripts/good-will-hunting-1997.pdf):

> WILL:  He used to just put a belt, a stick and a wrench on the kitchen table and say "choose."
>
> SEAN: Gotta go with the belt there...
>
> WILL: I used to go with the wrench.
>
> SEAN: The wrench, why?
>
> WILL: Cause fuck him, that's why.

Nod. That final line gets me.

"**_Fuck him, that's why!_**"

I guess it's all power fantasy.

But, it makes an impact :)
