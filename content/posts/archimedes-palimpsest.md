I read "[Eureka Man: The Life and Legacy of Archimedes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6785491-eureka-man)" last week.

Good book.

Half was a rough biography of Archimedes the other half was about the history of the [Archimedes Palimpsest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest).

I found the latter a whole lot more interesting. It dug into the history of this important document, something I was interested in/hoping for recently ([for example, with plato's dialogues](/blog/posts/textual-history/)).

Here's a summary of the palimpsest via gpt5.2:

> The **Archimedes Palimpsest** is a medieval parchment manuscript that preserves an overwritten Byzantine Greek copy of several works by the ancient mathematician **Archimedes** and other authors, originally written around the 10th century and later scraped and reused in the 13th century as a Christian prayer book (a *euchologion*). Because the original Archimedean texts were thought lost, the palimpsest is uniquely valuable: it contains the only known Greek versions of important works such as *On Floating Bodies*, *The Method of Mechanical Theorems* and *Stomachion*, among others, revealing insights into Archimedes’ use of mechanical reasoning and early ideas akin to integral calculus. Discovered in the early 20th century but hidden for decades, it was rediscovered at a 1998 auction and has since been studied with advanced imaging techniques that recover the erased undertext, profoundly enhancing our understanding of ancient science and mathematics.

The wikipedia entry is great, [read it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest).

Although this part of the book was fascinating, it could have been better if we had spent more time on the content of the palimpsest and what it illuminated for us that we did not know/have before. Perhaps it was mentioned, but only in passing. Dropping a chapter or two on this would have been better.
