title: 'AutoML Has A Marketing Problem'
---

I think [AutoML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning) is great.

I think most people should be using it. Even data scientists and machine learning engineers.

And not to "get started" but all the time on all things.

Why? It's probably better than you are.

I recall [Nick Erickson](https://x.com/innixma) (author of AutoGluon) commenting in one of his videos/interviews that AutoML/AutoGluon is as good or better than the average data scientist. That the bar for AutoML to clear is low, much lower than most people think. I don't have a quote at hand, sorry.

Agreed. I could not agree more.

So why aren't people using it? Why isn't it taking over?

Perhaps it is a marketing problem? Specifically [positioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)).

AutoML is a descriptive but not exciting/inspirational.

> Why would I want to automate the one fun thing about this whole area: desigining/iteresting modeling pipleines?

I agree too I guess.

But, as a project manager or client. No way. Get lost. Give an AutoML and only consider hand crafted pipelines if there's time or if there's a business need to do better.

I had a chat to gpt4o about the apparent marketing challenge that automl faces.

We came up with some positining and headlines.

Nothing crazy good, but interesting nonetheless:

Here are some headline ideas that present AutoML as a powerful, prestigious, and essential tool for data scientists and ML engineers:

1. **"Outperform, Outsmart, Outshine: Unlock Your Full Potential with AutoML"**

Meh.

I don't know how to solve this off hand, but my gut tells me it's a problem of positioning.
