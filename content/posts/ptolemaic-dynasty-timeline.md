title: 'Ptolemaic Dynasty Timeline'
---

I finished a book on the [Ptolemaic Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty) yesterday:

* [The Last Dynasty: Ancient Egypt From Alexander the Great to Cleopatra](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213395501-the-last-dynasty)

Not bad. Perhaps a little boring.

The dynasty did not last as long lasting was I thought (less than 300 years), and perhaps as expected, Alexandria -- specifically [the library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria), is the most interesting part.

The early part of the dynasty was more interesting (e.g. Ptolemy II and Ptolemy III). For example, the interactions with the islands in the Aegean, with Rhodes and Cypress, the back and forth with the mainland. The were big dogs in the region for a short while.

Anyway, to get things straight in my head, I asked gpt5 for an overview timeline:
