Below are some screenshots.

Here's the landing page that promote the benefits of copywork with lovecraft material specifically:

Here's the stories page:

You can pick a story and see which stories you have already started and their progress.

I generated iconic images for each story, gives a good horror feeling :)

Here's a copywork page:

You can see your progress on each passage, which passages are done and you get a confetti effect each time a passage is completed.

I'm very proud of this little site and I've been using it as daily as a warm-up exercise for my writing, and to system test the code :)

I hope other budding lovecraft/cosmic horror writers find it, and find it useful!
