I LOVE [Scavengers Reign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavengers_Reign).

Love.

What I love about it was also in the short on which the series is based: [Scavengers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TRzemJbUsw&ab_channel=CharlesHuettner).

Specifically:

- We're thrown in.
- Nothing is explained.
- The marooned characters already "know" how to do all the things.

It as though they are not marooned, that they have always been there and the knowledge has been passed down for millennia. But they are marooned, they're scavenging, motivated to survive and get back to the Demeter.

Also, it's super weird, in the best way.

It's as if the [southern reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Reach_Series) inspired an adult cartoon.

It also gives me vibes of the [Tales from the Loop](https://www.goodreads.com/series/308269-tales-from-the-loop) books + [tv show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Loop). Another world. Familiar, but different, and the inhabitants know how to operate it. And it's beautiful.

The creators should get all the money and make as much of it as they want.

It's a terrible shame there will be no season 2, and very cool that the creators [released the teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSEPJ9OtQb8).

My god, its good.
