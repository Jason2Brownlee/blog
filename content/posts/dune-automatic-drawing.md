title: 'Dune Automatic Drawing'
---

I watched [Dune: Prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Prophecy) recently.

Meh.

There was a cool scene were all the sisters were hypnotized as a group and proceeded to perform automatic drawing together.

Without obvious suggestion, they all draw the same things in image after image. A shared nightmare.

The final image they all draw is black with two white eyes. The two eyes are motif from the season.

Very cool idea. The whole scene is great.

Here's the scene on YouTube, about 4 minutes in length:
