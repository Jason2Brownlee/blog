I re-read a ton.

Maybe 1/4 of the books I read in a year.

Sometimes more.

Taking "[Do you have books you re-read regularly?](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1j129hp/do_you_have_books_you_reread_regularly/)" as a prompt, I commented the following:

---
I re-read the following each year:

* Ambergris (3 books), Vandermeer
* Area X/Southern Reach (3 books), Vandermeer
* Hyperion, Simmons
* Enders Game, Scott Card
* Flowers for Algernon, Keyes

Some others I'll re-read every other year:

* Blood Meridian, McCarthy
* The Fountainhead, Rand
* Do the Work, Pressfield
* Call of Cthulhu, Lovecraft
* Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Pirsig
* Solaris, Lem
* Antifragile, Taleb

Why? I guess to recapture the feeling of that first read :)

Because they're awesome.

Nod.

"_Because they're awesome_" is enough of a reason.

The context above was scifi, but some non-fiction slipped in.

There's also a ton of business and writing books I re-read often. Typically at the start of a project - to fire me up.

I also re-brainwash myself using nook on topics like health and investing.

Perhaps they're books lists for another time.
