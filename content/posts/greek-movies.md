title: 'Movies in/about Greece'

In preparation for our trip to Greece, I was thinking of movies I could watch with my eldest.

The idea, along with a reading list, is to fill his head with history/culture and build anticipation.

He's 14-15, so I'm leaning more toward action/battles/greek gods/etc.

Here's what I came up with:

* [Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians:_The_Lightning_Thief) (2010)
* [Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson:_Sea_of_Monsters) (2013)
* [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_(film)) (2004)
* [Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_(2004_film)) (2004)
* [300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)) (2006)
* [Clash of the Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_the_Titans_(2010_film)) (2011)
* [Wrath of the Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath_of_the_Titans) (2012)
* [Immortals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortals_(2011_film)) (2011)
* [Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(2014_film)) (2014)

That's a good start.

Also the upcoming [The Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey_(2026_film)) by Christopher Nolan in 2026.
