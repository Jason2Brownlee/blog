title: 'Border Science'
---

I finished "[Hitler's Monsters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35238287-hitler-s-monsters)" yesterday.

Meh.

Anyway, the book uses a term I'd not heard: "**border science**".

I took it to mean pseudoscience, or occultism broadly conceived.

Maybe.

Wikipedia says [Pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience) is stuff that is not science because it's not testable, e.g. falsifiable.

> Pseudoscience consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that claim to be both scientific and factual but are incompatible with the scientific method.

Wikipedia has "[Fringe Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_science)" which seems different again, e.g. fake science.

> Fringe science refers to ideas whose attributes include being highly speculative or relying on premises already refuted. Fringe science theories are often advanced by people who have no traditional academic science background, or by researchers outside the mainstream discipline.

And:

> The term "fringe science" covers everything from novel hypotheses, which can be tested utilizing the scientific method, to wild ad hoc hypotheses and mumbo jumbo. This has resulted in a tendency to dismiss all fringe science as the domain of pseudoscientists, hobbyists, and quacks.

Then, what's "border science"?

Chatting to gpt4o and claude, they have similar thoughts.

They suggest fringe science is an attempt to use scientific methods on theories that depart from the mainstream. Perhaps different from the above definition.

For example, from claude:

> "**Fringe science**" describes theories and methodologies that depart significantly from mainstream scientific understanding but still attempt to use scientific methods. Unlike pseudoscience, fringe science:
>
> * Attempts to follow scientific methodology
> * Makes testable predictions
> * May be pursued by people with scientific credentials
> * Could potentially be proven valid through further research
> * Historical examples include continental drift when first proposed, or cold fusion research.

Some examples:

> * Parapsychology research using controlled studies
> * Cold fusion experiments continuing after mainstream rejection
> * Theories about multiple dimensions beyond current physics models
> * Alternative cosmology models challenging Big Bang theory
> * Unconventional approaches to quantum interpretation

And gpt4o:

> **Definition**: Scientific theories or ideas that are on the extreme edges of mainstream scientific understanding. These may be speculative but are not necessarily pseudoscientific.

Fair enough.

They both go on to suggest that border science sits between accepted science and border science.

From claude:

> "**Border science**" (also called frontier science) occupies the boundary between established science and fringe science. It typically involves:
>
> * New hypotheses that challenge current paradigms
> * Areas where evidence is still being gathered
> * Topics that mainstream science hasn't fully evaluated
> * Research that uses accepted methods but reaches controversial conclusions
> * Examples might include certain aspects of consciousness research or some alternative energy theories.

Some more examples:

> * Certain consciousness studies (like research into near-death experiences)
> * Some alternative energy concepts being tested in labs
> * Emerging theories in quantum biology
> * Research into anomalous cognition under controlled conditions
> * Studies of potential extraterrestrial technosignatures

And gpt4o:

> **Definition**: A broad and less commonly used term that describes research that lies on the boundary between accepted science and speculation. It overlaps with fringe science.

Okay.

So border science are fields that could be science, are probably not, probably easily refuted by a well trained physicists, but the people who work on them are (attempting) to use scientific methods. Once in a blue moon a fringe science topic/hypothesis might move over to real science, probably with a new name.

And pseudoscience is unambiguously garbage - yet hangs on with lay-peoples :)

Before all the low hanging fruit was picked (last 150 years) most things were probably fringe science, until they were figured out. The effects of electricity and magnetism are pretty wild and the cool kids were playing with it in their basements in the 19th century.
