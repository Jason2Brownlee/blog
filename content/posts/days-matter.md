title: 'Days Matter'

Days slip through your fingers like water.

You need a goal or objective and you must to keep moving toward it.

Otherwise, time passes, you look up and you have lost weeks, months, years with nothing to show for it. The time is all burned up. Consumed. Spent. Stolen.

Each and every day matters.

Set aside a block of time and make progress toward the current thing.

Once the objective is reached, set a new one. Fast.

Have a backlog so you can pop the next one from the stack and again, make daily progress.

Will it always be this way?

I think so.

I think it's an organizing principle for your life.

Without it, each thing will fall apart. Health, relationships, wisdom, finances, and on.

* This is why a gap year is a terrible idea.
* This is why an unmotivated sabbatical is a terrible idea.
* This is why underemployment is a terrible idea.

Can there be a break? Sure. Pre-specified and fixed-term. Short.

Days matter.

Use each one wisely.

Get to it!
