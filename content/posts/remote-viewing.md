Before Christmas I listened to the [Telepathy Tapes](https://thetelepathytapes.com/) podcast.

I heard about it on a Joe Rogan podcast and added it to the queue immediately.

I think it went viral because there was a lot of chatter on twitter/reddit about it around this time.

Here's a plot of google trend data:

You can see the leap in interest right around the airing of [Joe's episode with Duncan Trussell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao).

When I started listening to the Telepathy Tapes podcast, I could not believe what I was hearing. I fact, I binged the program and thought that it was fiction dressed as non-fiction, a genre I LOVE!

Nope. They are earnest. The result is that I have no idea what is going on, other than the thought:

> Do some hard science on this stuff and tell me what you find out!

Where are the physicists?

They probably got me. Maybe it's real!?! Oh man, I'm a sucker.

Anyway, I searched around for similar content and found the Shawn Ryan Show and a suite of eposides on remote viewing.

I will listen to an occasional Shawn Ryan episode, mainly those on special operators. Remote viewing sounded bunk.

Anyway, I drank them down.

Most of it sounded like total bunk. Some of it though... damn it! They got me too.

So I went off and read some books:

* [Phenomena](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30841980-phenomena), Annie Jacobsen.
* [Penetration](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/691686.Penetration), Ingo Swann.
* [Mind-Reach](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182428.Mind_Reach), Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff.

"Phenomena" is a fun read and I've read other books by Annie Jacobsen. I'll probably read more.

"Penetration", nope. Not into it at all.

"Mind-Reach" reads partly like a bag of research papers and partly like a research journal. I like it.

If (big IF!) this stuff isn't bunk, then surely an ensemble of viewers is the move here for any real-world tasking?

Anyway, if I ever write fiction, it's going to come across like the Telepathy Tapes or Mind-Reach.
