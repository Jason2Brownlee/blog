title: 'Audience of One'

I listened to [KK](https://kk.org/) on "[AI & I](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1m1tdBVl0VP5XH36mIoy16)" with [Dan Shipper](https://x.com/danshipper):

* [How to Predict the Future Like Kevin Kelly](https://every.to/podcast/how-to-predict-the-future-like-kevin-kelly)

KK is always good.

He talked about one of his AI experiments of getting Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Luther, and Christopher Columbus to have a meeting, to create a new city and a whole world around this idea via wikipedia pages.

And importantly, that he did it for the pure enjoyment of it.

> And then I had it making book covers and writing the marketing materials. And the point of all this is that I'm not gonna show it to anybody because I don't need to. The joy of creating it was better than reading it. It was the audience of one.

Exactly:

> "_**The joy of creating it was better than reading it.**_"

Generative AI as hobby. An audience of one.

I have been chewing on the same ideas. There is no market for the little software projects and novellas I'm building. They are for me and they are disposable. The joy is in the making.

> And so what I'm hypothesizing is a lot of the generative stuff, the 50 million images that are generated each day with AI, 99.999 percent have an audience of one, they're generated for the pleasure of the co-creator.

Yes.

This:

> "_**...they're generated for the pleasure of the co-creator**_"

Exactly.

There is no economic model for the co-creator. There is an audience of one.

And that is okay.

Somewhere along the way, we got the idea that everything has to be a side hustle. It doesn't! We don't have to monetize all creations. And LLMs let's us do a whole lot more creating, if we let it.

> I think this is a kind of a different form of entertainment or self-expression. It's just like Sunday painting or keeping a journal or someone doing ice skating. It's a form of self-expression, relaxation, enjoyment, and entertainment. So it's closer to entertainment than it is to actually a career.

A type of self-expression.

Entertainment. Not career.

This is soothing perspective. And one I've been trying to sell my wife on for weeks :)

Back to creating.
