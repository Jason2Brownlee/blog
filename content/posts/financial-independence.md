[Financial Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence) is wild.

I've been Financial Independence or "FI" since the end of 2021 (maybe December 2021), so 3 and a bit years. Not rich, but time wealthy. I don't have to be anywhere or do anything unless I want (or my wife/family want or need).

Here's a definition from gpt4o:

> Financial independence is the state of having sufficient personal wealth to live comfortably without needing to actively work for basic living expenses. It means your investments, savings, or passive income sources—such as rental properties, dividends, or interest—generate enough income to cover your lifestyle costs. Achieving financial independence often involves disciplined saving, smart investing, and careful budgeting over time. It allows individuals greater freedom to choose how they spend their time, whether that’s continuing to work by choice, pursuing passion projects, or retiring early.

Once FI, the next step is to truly do what you want. Typically: Retire Early, RE. (Note FI + RE is [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement)). RE is when you stop trading time for money.

For me, **how could the goal ever not be financial independence to then retire early?**

Who the hell wants to be told what to do and where to go for 50+ years? Most people I guess.

Not me!

I've been bailing out for years. Research was a way of bailing out first. Entrepreneurship was a way of bailing out second, and this approach worked for good.

So, how do you live while retired early?

Have modest desires. Live modestly.

I think it helps a lot to *have inexpensive hobbies.*

The thing you do every day, the thing you love is cheap or free.

Cap outgoings at something really low. Keep the burn rate down and the enjoyment up.

For example:

* Read books
* Work out
* Write code/words
* Travel
* Help people

For me, I just want to read and think about stuff all day :)

To be curious.

To read and research.

I once joked to a friend that I'm a "gentleman scientist". Not really though, my interests jump around too much.

Via gpt4o:

> A *gentleman scientist* is an individual who conducts scientific research independently, often without formal affiliation to academic or governmental institutions, and typically funds their own work. Historically, the term referred to wealthy, well-educated men—especially in the 17th to 19th centuries—who pursued scientific inquiry as a hobby or passion rather than a profession. Notable examples include Charles Darwin and Benjamin Franklin. While the term has largely fallen out of use in modern science due to the rise of institutionalized research and professionalization, it still connotes a spirit of curiosity-driven exploration outside traditional academic structures.

FIRE forces you to take a hard look at yourself, at what you do, what you believe, at meaning.

I used to think I "was" a programmer. But it turns out, I can program, I even like to write code, but I'm not a programmer.

Similarly, I can start and run businesses, I like many aspects of it, but I'm, not an entrepreneur.

How do I know these things?

Because if I don't have to do these things, I'd rather not. If I were a programmer or entrepreneur, then I could not not do those things (yes, a double negative).

- A programmer can't not program.
- A entrepreneur can't not start and run businesses.

For me, I can't not read books every day. I can't not do little writing or research projects. To tinker with ideas.

It's liberating to figure out yourself. But hard emotional work.
