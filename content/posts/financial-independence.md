[Financial Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence) is wild.

I've been Financial Independence or "FI" since the end of 2021 (maybe December 2021), so 3 and a bit years. Not rich, but time wealthy. I don't have to be anywhere or do anything unless I want (or my wife/family want or need).

Here's a definition from gpt4o:

> Financial independence is the state of having sufficient personal wealth to live comfortably without needing to actively work for basic living expenses. It means your investments, savings, or passive income sources—such as rental properties, dividends, or interest—generate enough income to cover your lifestyle costs. Achieving financial independence often involves disciplined saving, smart investing, and careful budgeting over time. It allows individuals greater freedom to choose how they spend their time, whether that’s continuing to work by choice, pursuing passion projects, or retiring early.

Once FI, the next step is to truly do what you want. Typically: Retire Early, RE. To stop trading time for money. But people can't or won't.

Average people don't want FI or RE. They might say they do, but they probably don't. It's too much freedom.

I suspect most people would rather look rich (fancy cars, house, kids school, stuff) than be truly financially independent, i.e. he option to be time wealthy. They create traps for themselves to ensure they can't be independent. Like loans and payment plans, and other systems that require ever increasing cash flow.

If you are free, totally free, to do what you want each day, how would anyone know? How would you be able to show it off? Whereas if you're "rich", you can go to work and show off your car/watch/house/holidays whatever. Most people need to know where they fit into the status hierarchy, at least with people they know.

Maybe this is why many people who could be free to not work given their finances, chose not to. Perhaps the option is so alien that it's never even considered, i.e. if you can work (earn income), you should. There's never "enough". I no longer try to point this out to people. Everyone's making choices, even if implicitly.

Or perhaps, people have no idea what to do with themselves if they were free. This is probably a massive issue. If all you do is work and family, how would you fill your days if you didn't have to go to work and the rest of your family was at school all day? Watch tiktok all day? It would get really old, fast.

For me, I think it helps a lot to: **have inexpensive hobbies!**

Inexpensive ways to spend your days is key, I think. Keep the burn rate down and the enjoyment up.

For example:

* Read books
* Work out
* Write code/words
* Travel
* Help people

Be curious.

Read and research.

I once joked to a friend that I'm a "gentleman scientist".

Via gpt4o:

> A *gentleman scientist* is an individual who conducts scientific research independently, often without formal affiliation to academic or governmental institutions, and typically funds their own work. Historically, the term referred to wealthy, well-educated men—especially in the 17th to 19th centuries—who pursued scientific inquiry as a hobby or passion rather than a profession. Notable examples include Charles Darwin and Benjamin Franklin. While the term has largely fallen out of use in modern science due to the rise of institutionalized research and professionalization, it still connotes a spirit of curiosity-driven exploration outside traditional academic structures.

I just want to read and think about stuff all day :)

It forces you to take a hard look at yourself, at what you do, what you believe, at meaning.

I used to think I "was" a programmer. But it turns out, I can program, I even like to write code, but I'm not a programmer.

Similarly, I can start and run businesses, I like many aspects of it, but I'm, not an entrepreneur.

How do I know these things?

Because if I don't have to do these things, I'd rather not. If I were a programmer or entrepreneur, then I could not not do those things (yes, a double negative).

- A programmer can't not program.
- A entrepreneur can't not start and run businesses.

For me, I can't not read books every day. I can't not do little writing or research projects. To tinker with ideas.

It's liberating to figure out yourself.
