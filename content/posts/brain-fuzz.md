title: 'Brain Fuzz'
---

I was travelling for some time recently. Many weeks.

During that time, I pulled back on reading books and even on consuming long-form podcasts.

Instead, I consumed vast amounts of social, specifically Instagram and TikTok.

They are amazing at narrowing in on my interest of the moment.

But I found that I felt off. Wrong.

The best way I can describe it is my brain was fuzzy.

I could not think clearly. I didn't care so much about "stuff". I was lethargic. I didn't want to eat right or go to the gym. I just stopped caring.

It was hard to pull out of this malaise, even after the travel stopped and I was home again and in routine stuff.

As soon as I started reading long form again, I awoke. I deleted the apps and everything is on track again.

So strange. Maybe cause and effect. Maybe a latent cause (e.g. the travel itself). Not sure.

I did learn some things for social, e.g. about where to visit, how to exercise different, maybe some other on-demand things.

Worth it? Nope.
