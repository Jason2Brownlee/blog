I've been using [grok3](https://x.ai/blog/grok-3) for a few days, since release (4-5 days now?).

Chatting is fine. I still do ad hoc chat with gpt4o and deepseek.

DeepSearch is great. I have not used this much, but I like it. I guess I don't trust the open web. I'd rather specify sources.

I LOVE "Think" in grok3.

I've compared reasoning results to o1 and o3 mini and for my recent use cases, I prefer grok3. Taste I guess.

And [Claude 3.7 is out this morning](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet). Terrible "name" / "version".

Eager to see what it can do with this mornings workload.

I read Ethan's "[A new generation of AIs: Claude 3.7 and Grok 3](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/a-new-generation-of-ais-claude-37)" and he's impressed with the new Claude. It looks promising.

He's calling these two models along with o3 (full) "gen-3". Okay.

> Today, Claude 3.7 joined the Gen3 club (though we do not know precisely how many FLOPs it was trained on), and while it is similar in benchmarks to Grok 3, I personally find it more clever for my use cases, but you may find otherwise. The still unreleased o3 from OpenAI also seems to be a Gen3 model, with excellent performance. It is likely this is just the beginning - more companies are gearing up to launch their own models at this scale.

We live in amazing times!
