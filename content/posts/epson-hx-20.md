I was [commenting on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ik8axj/comment/mbkf70c/) how I used to type in [BASIC programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) back when learning the craft.

I then recalled that I had an old "laptop" that only _did_ BASIC.

After some searching, I found it:

It was an **Epson HX-20**, pictured below (photo [from wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Epson-hx-20.jpg)):

Oh man, it was cool.

More from wiki's [history of laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_laptops):

> The first significant development towards laptop computing was announced in 1981 and sold from July 1982, the 8/16-bit Epson HX-20.

And:

> The HX-20 was the first laptop to be called a notebook.

It came in a hard plastic case and had manuals, including a book of code examples (which I typed), many of which created lists or pictures that could be printed.

I had a PC at this time, [my own PC that was awesome](/blog/posts/first-serious-pc/), but even then I knew this thing was "cool" (to me).

The keys were where springy, not clicky. Like too springy.

It had a built-in tape drive and dot-matrix printer.

Actually, the pic above is not right, it does not have the tape drive, this is more like it this (from [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/395518792422)):

Note the tape drive on the top right. Also note the hard plastic case.

As I said, all it did was basic.

I wish I kept it. Would I ever use it? Probably not.

Vintage-cool computing.

It seems you can get them on ebay for few hundred or a thousand dollars. Ouch.

As I recall, I got via my dad, who said the were put in a dumpster at his work (circa mid-late 1990s).
